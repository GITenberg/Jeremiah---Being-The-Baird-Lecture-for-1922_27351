<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The purpose and the scope of this volume are
set forth in the beginning of Lecture I. Lecture
II. explains the various metrical forms in which I
understand Jeremiah to have delivered the most
of his prophecies, and which I have endeavoured,
however imperfectly, to reproduce in English.
Here it is necessary only to emphasise the variety
of these forms, the irregularities which are found
in them, and the occasional passage of the
Prophet from verse to prose and from prose to
verse, after the manner of some other bards or
rhapsodists of his race. The reader will keep in
mind that what appear as metrical irregularities
on the printed page would not be felt to be so
when sung or chanted; just as is the case with
the folk-songs of Palestine to-day. I am well
aware that metres so primitive and by our canons
so irregular have been more rhythmically rendered
by the stately prose of our English Versions;
yet it is our duty reverently to seek for the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
original forms and melodies of what we believe
to be the Oracles of God. The only other point
connected with the metrical translations offered,
which need be mentioned here, is that I have
rendered the name of the God of Israel as it is
by the Greek and our own Versions—The Lord—which
is more suitable to English verse than
is either Yahweh or Jehovah.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The text of the Lectures and the footnotes
show how much I owe to those who have already
written on Jeremiah, as also in what details I
differ from one or another of them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have retained the form of Lectures for this
volume, but I have very much expanded and
added to what were only six Lectures of an hour
each when delivered under the auspices of the
Baird Trust in Glasgow in 1922.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First of all, I thank the Baird Trustees for their
graceful appointment to this Lecture of a member
of what is still, though please God not for long,
another Church than their own. I am very grateful
for the privilege which they grant me of returning
to Glasgow with the accomplishment of
a work the materials for which were largely
gathered during the years of my professorship in
the city. The value of the opportunity is enhanced
by all that has since befallen our nation
and the world. The Great War invested the
experience of the Prophet, who is the subject of
this Lecture, with a fresh and poignant relevance
to our own problems and duties. Like ourselves,
Jeremiah lived through the clash not only of
empires but of opposite ethical ideals, through
the struggles and panics of small peoples, through
long and terrible fighting, famine, and slaughter
of the youth of the nations, with all the anxieties
to faith and the problems of Providence, which
such things naturally raise. Passionate for peace,
he was called to proclaim the inevitableness of
war, in opposition to the popular prophets of a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
false peace; but later he had to counsel his
people to submit to their foes and to accept their
captivity, thus facing the hardest conflict a man
can who loves his own—between patriotism and
common sense, between his people's gallant efforts
for freedom and the stern facts of the world,
between national traditions and pieties on the
one side and on the other what he believed to
be the Will of God. These are issues which
the successive generations of our race are called
almost ceaselessly to face; and the teaching and
example of the great Prophet, who dealt with
them through such strenuous debates both with
his fellow-men and with his God, and who brought
out of these debates spiritual results of such
significance for the individual and for the nation,
cannot be without value for ourselves.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this and the following lectures I attempt an
account and estimate of the Prophet Jeremiah, of
his life and teaching, and of the Book which contains
them—but especially of the man himself,
his personality and his tempers (there were more
than one), his religious experience and its achievements,
with the various high styles of their expression;
as well as his influence on the subsequent
religion of his people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has often been asserted that in Jeremiah's
ministry more than in any other of the Old
Covenant the personality of the Prophet was
under God the dominant factor, and one has even
said that <span class="tei tei-q">“his predecessors were the originators
of great truths, which he transmuted into spiritual
life.”</span><a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
To avoid exaggeration here, we must keep
in mind how large a part personality played in
their teaching also, and from how deep in their
lives their messages sprang. Even Amos was no
mere <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">voice crying in the wilderness</span></span>. The discipline
of the desert, the clear eye for ordinary facts and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the sharp ear for sudden alarms which it breeds,
along with the desert shepherd's horror of the
extravagance and cruelties of civilisation—all
these reveal to us the Man behind the Book, who
had lived his truth before he uttered it. Hosea
again, tells the story of his outraged love as
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the beginning of the Word of the Lord by him</span></span>. And
it was the strength of Isaiah's character, which,
unaided by other human factors, carried Judah,
with the faith she enshrined, through the first
great crisis of her history. Yet recognise, as we
justly may, the personalities of these prophets in
the nerve, the colour, the accent, and even the
substance of their messages, we must feel the
still greater significance of Jeremiah's temperament
and other personal qualities both for his
own teaching and for the teaching of those who
came after him. Thanks to his loyal scribe,
Baruch, we know more of the circumstances of
his career, and thanks to his own frankness, we
know more of his psychology than we do in the
case of any of his predecessors. He has, too,
poured out his soul to us by the most personal
of all channels; the charm, passion and poignancy
of his verse lifting him high among the poets of
Israel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So far as our materials enable us to judge no
other prophet was more introspective or concerned
about himself; and though it might be
said that he carried this concern to a fault, yet
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fault or none, the fact is that no prophet started
so deeply from himself as Jeremiah did. His
circumstances flung him in upon his feelings and
convictions; he was constantly searching, doubting,
confessing, and pleading for, himself. He
asserted more strenuously than any except Job
his individuality as against God, and he stood in
more lonely opposition to his people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jeremiah was called to prophesy about the
time that the religion of Israel was re-codified in
Deuteronomy—the finest system of national religion
which the world has seen, but only and
exclusively national—and he was still comparatively
young when that system collapsed for
the time and the religion itself seemed about to
perish with it. He lived to see the Law fail, the
Nation dispersed, and the National Altar shattered;
but he gathered their fire into his bosom and
carried it not only unquenched but with a purer
flame towards its everlasting future. We may
say without exaggeration that what was henceforth
finest in the religion of Israel had, however
ancient its sources, been recast in the furnace of
his spirit. With him the human unit in religion
which had hitherto been mainly the nation was on
the way to become the individual. Personal piety
in later Israel largely grew out of his spiritual
struggles.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His forerunners, it is true, had insisted that
religion was an affair not of national institutions
nor of outward observance, but of the people's
heart—by which heart they and their hearers
must have understood the individual hearts composing
it. But, in urging upon his generation
repentance, faith and conversion to God, Jeremiah's
language is more thorough and personal
than that used by any previous prophet. The
individual, as he leaves Jeremiah's hands, is more
clearly the direct object of the Divine Interest
and Grace, and the instrument of the Divine Will.
The single soul is searched, defined and charged
as never before in Israel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But this sculpture of the individual out of the
mass of the nation, this articulation of his immediate
relation to God apart from Law, Temple
and Race, achieved as it was by Jeremiah only
through intense mental and physical agonies,
opened to him the problem of the sufferings of
the righteous. In his experience the individual
realised his Self only to find that Self—its rights,
the truths given it and its best service for God—baffled
by the stupidity and injustice of those
for whom it laboured and agonised. The mists
of pain and failure bewildered the Prophet and to
the last his work seemed in vain. Whether or
not he himself was conscious of the solution of
the problem, others reached it through him.
There are grounds for believing that the Figure
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Suffering Servant of the Lord, raised by
the Great Prophet of the Exile, and the idea of
the atoning and redemptive value of His sufferings
were, in part at least, the results of meditation
upon the spiritual loneliness on the one side, and
upon the passionate identification of himself with
the sorrows of his sinful people on the other, of
this the likest to Christ of all the prophets.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For our knowledge of this great life—there was
none greater under the Old Covenant—we are
dependent on that Book of our Scriptures, the
Hebrew text of which bears the simple title
<span class="tei tei-q">“Jeremiah.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The influence of the life and therefore the full
stature of the man who lived it, stretches, as I
have hinted, to the latest bounds of Hebrew
history, and many writings and deeds were
worshipfully assigned to him. Thus the Greek
Version of the Old Testament ascribes Lamentations
to Jeremiah, but the poems themselves do
not claim to be, and obviously are not, from
himself. He is twice quoted in II. Chronicles
and once in Ezra, but these quotations may be
reasonably interpreted as referring to prophecies
contained in our book, which were therefore
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
extant before the date of the Chronicler.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> Ecclesiasticus
XLIX. 6-7 reflects passages of our Book,
and of Lamentations, as though equally Jeremiah's,
and Daniel IX. 2 refers to Jeremiah XXV.
12. A paragraph in the Second Book of Maccabees,
Ch. II. 1-8, contains, besides echoes of
our Book of Jeremiah, references to other activities
of the Prophet of which the sources and the value
are unknown to us. But all these references, as
well as the series of apocryphal and apocalyptic
works to which the name either of Jeremiah himself
or of Baruch, his scribe, has been attached,<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>
only reveal the length of the shadow which the
Prophet's figure cast down the ages, and contribute
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
no verifiable facts to our knowledge of his
career or of his spiritual experience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the actual life of Jeremiah, for the man as
he was to himself and his contemporaries, for his
origin, character, temper, struggles, growth and
modes of expression, we have practically no
materials beyond the Canonical Book to which
his name is prefixed.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Roughly classified the contents of the Book
(after the extended title in Ch. I. 1-3) are as
follows:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. A Prologue, Ch. I. 4-19, in which the Prophet
tells the story of his call and describes the range
of his mission as including both his own people
and foreign nations. The year of his call was
627-6 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. A large number of Oracles, dialogues between
the Prophet and the Deity and symbolic
actions by the Prophet issuing in Oracles, mostly
introduced as by Jeremiah himself, but sometimes
reported of him by another. Most of the Oracles
are in verse; the style of the rest is not distinguishable
by us from prose. They deal almost
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
exclusively with the Prophet's own people though
there are some references to neighbouring tribes.
The bulk of this class of the contents is found
within Chs. II-XXV, which contain all the
earlier oracles, i.e. those uttered by Jeremiah
before the death of King Josiah in 608, but also
several of his prophecies under Jehoiakim and
even Ṣedekiah. More of the latter are found
within Chs. XXVII-XXXV: all these, except
XXVIII and part of XXXII, which are introduced
by the Prophet himself, are reported by another.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. A separate group of Oracles on Foreign
Nations, Chs. XLVI-LI, reported to us as
Jeremiah's.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. A number of narratives of episodes in the
Prophet's life from 608 onwards under Jehoiakim
and Ṣedekiah to the end in Egypt, soon after
586; apparently by a contemporary and eyewitness
who on good grounds is generally taken to be
Baruch the Scribe: Chs. XXVI, XXXVI-XLV;
but to the same source may be due much of Chs.
XXVII-XXXV (see under 2).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. Obvious expansions and additions throughout
all the foregoing; and a historical appendix in
Ch. LII, mainly an excerpt from II. Kings XXIV-XXV.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the face of it, then, the Book is a compilation
from several sources; and perhaps we ought
to translate the opening clause of its title not as
in our versions <span class="tei tei-q">“The Words of Jeremiah,”</span> but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The History of Jeremiah,”</span> as has been legitimately
done by some scholars since Kimchi.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What were the nuclei of this compilation?
How did they originate? What proofs do they
give of their value as historical documents? How
did they come together? And what changes, if
any, did they suffer before the compilation closed
and the Book received its present form?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These questions must be answered, so far as
possible, before we can give an account of the
Prophet's life or an estimate of himself and his
teaching. The rest of this lecture is an attempt
to answer them—but in the opposite order to that
in which I have just stated them. We shall work
backward from the two ultimate forms in which
the Book has come down to us. For these forms
are two.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides the Hebrew text, from which the
Authorised and Revised English Versions have
been made, we possess a form of the Book in
Greek, which is part of the Greek Version of the
Old Testament known as the Septuagint. This
is virtually another edition of the same work.
The Hebrew text belongs to the Second or
Prophetical Canon of the Jewish Scriptures, which
was not closed till about 200 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span>, or more than
350 years after Jeremiah's death. The Greek
Version was completed about the same time, and
possibly earlier.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These two editions of the Book hold by far the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
greatest part of their contents in common, yet
they differ considerably in the amount and in
the arrangement of their contents, and somewhat
less in the dates and personal references which
they apply to various passages. We have thus
before us two largely independent witnesses who
agree in the bulk of their testimony, and otherwise
correct and supplement each other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In size the Greek Book of Jeremiah is but
seven-eighths of the Hebrew,<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> but conversely it
contains some hundred words that the Hebrew
lacks. Part of this small Greek surplus is due to
the translators' expansion or paraphrase of briefer
Hebrew originals, or consists of glosses that
they found in the Hebrew MSS. from which they
translated, or added of themselves; the rest is
made up of what are probably original phrases
but omitted from the Hebrew by the carelessness
of copyists; yet none of these differences is of
importance save where the Greek corrects an
irregularity in the Hebrew metre, or yields sense
when the Hebrew fails to do so.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
More instructive is the greater number of
phrases and passages found in the Hebrew Book,
and consequently in our English Versions, but absent
from the Greek. Some, it is true, are merely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
formal—additions to a personal name of the title
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">king</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prophet</span></span>
or of the names of a father and
grandfather, or the more frequent use of the divine
title <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">of Hosts</span></span> with the personal Name of the Deity
or of the phrase <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rede of the
Lord</span></span>.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>
Also the Greek omits words which in the Hebrew are obviously
mistakes of a copyist.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>
Again, a number of what
are transparent glosses or marginal notes on the
Hebrew text are lacking in the Greek, because
the translator of the latter did not find them on
the Hebrew manuscript from which he translated.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a>
Some titles to sections of the Book, or portions of
titles, absent from the Greek but found in our
Hebrew text, are also later editorial additions.<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>
Greater importance, however, attaches to those
phrases that cannot be mere glosses and to the
longer passages, wanting in the Greek but found
in the Hebrew, many of which upon internal evidence
must be regarded as late intrusions into
the latter.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>
And occasionally a word or phrase
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the Hebrew, which spoils the rhythm or is
irrelevant to the sense, is not found in the
Greek.<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally, there is one great difference of arrangement.
The group of Oracles on Foreign
Nations which appear in the Hebrew as Chs.
XLVI-LI are in the Greek placed between verses
13 and 15<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> of Ch. XXV, and are ranged in a
different order—an obvious proof that at one
time different editors felt free to deal with the
arrangement of the compilation as well as to add
to its contents.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Modern critics differ as to the comparative
value of these two editions of the Book of Jeremiah,
and there are strong advocates on either
side.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> But
the prevailing opinion, and, to my
view, the right one, is that no general judgment
is possible, and that each case of difference
between the two witnesses must be decided by
itself.<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> With this, however, we have nothing at
present to do. What concerns us now is the fact
that the Greek is not the translation of the
canonical Hebrew text, but that the two Books,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
while sharing a common basis of wide extent,
represent two different lines of compilation and
editorial development which continued till at least
200 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span> Between them they are the proof that,
while our Bible was still being compiled, some
measure of historical criticism and of editorial
activity was at work on the material—and this
not only along one line. We need not stop to
discuss how far the fact justifies the exercise of
criticism by the modern Church. For our present
purpose it is enough to keep in mind that our
Book of Jeremiah is the result of a long development
through some centuries and on more than
one line, though the two divergent movements
started with, and carried down, a large body of
material in common.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, this common material bears evidence
of having already undergone similar treatment,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em> it passed out on those two lines
of further development which resulted in the
canonical Hebrew text and the Greek Version
respectively. The signs of gradual compilation
are everywhere upon the material which they
share in common. Now and then a chronological
order appears, and indeed there are traces of a
purpose to pursue that order throughout. But
this has been disturbed by cross-arrangements
according to subject,<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> and by the intrusion of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
later oracles and episodes among earlier ones<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span><a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> as if their materials had come into the
hands of the compilers or editors of the Book
only gradually. Another proof of the gradual
growth of those contents, which are common to the
Hebrew and the Greek, is the fashion in which they
tend to run away from the titles prefixed to them.
Take the title to the whole Book,<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a>
Ch. I. 2, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Which
was the Word of the Lord to Jeremiah in the days of
Josiah, son of Amon, King of Judah, in the thirteenth
year of his reign</span></span>. This covers only the narrative
of the Prophet's call in Ch. I, or at most a few
of the Oracles in the following chapters. The
supplementary title in verse 3—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It came also in the
days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, King of Judah,
up to [the end of]</span><a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; font-style: italic; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a><span style="font-style: italic"> the eleventh year of Ṣedekiah, the
son of Josiah King of Judah, up to the exile of Jerusalem,
in the fifth month</span></span>—is probably a later addition,
added when the later Oracles of Jeremiah were
attached to some collection of those which he
had delivered under Josiah; but even then the
title fails to cover those words in the Book which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Jeremiah spake after Jerusalem had gone into
exile, and even after he had been hurried down
into Egypt by a base remnant of his people.<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>
Moreover, the historical appendix to the Book
carries the history it contains on to 561 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span> at
least.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> Again there are passages, the subjects of
which are irrelevant to their context, and which
break the clear connection of the parts of the
context between which they have intruded.<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a>
The shorter sentences, that also disturb the connection
as they stand, appear to have been
written originally as marginal notes which a
later editor or copyist has incorporated in the
text.<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a>
To this class, too, may belong those brief
passages which appear twice, once in their natural
connection in some later chapter and once out of
their natural connection in some earlier chapter.<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a>
And again in VII. 1-28 and XXVI. 1-9 we have
two accounts, apparently from different hands,
of what may or may not be the same episode in
Jeremiah's ministry.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These data clearly prove that not only from
the time when the Hebrew and Greek editions
of the Book started upon their separate lines of
development, but from the very beginnings of
the Book's history, the work of accumulation, arrangement
and re-arrangement, with other editorial
processes, had been busy upon it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next question is, have we any criteria by
which to discriminate between the elements in the
Book that belong either to Jeremiah himself or
to his contemporaries and others that are due to
editors or compilers between his death soon after
586 and the close of the Prophetic Canon in
200 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span>? The answer is that we have such
criteria. All Oracles or Narratives in the Book,
which (apart from obvious intrusions) imply that
the Exile is well advanced or that the Return
from Exile has already happened, or which reflect
the circumstances of the later Exile and
subsequent periods or the spirit of Israel and the
teaching of her prophets and scribes in those
periods, we may rule out of the material on
which we can rely for our knowledge of Jeremiah's
life and his teaching. Of such Exilic and
post-Exilic contents there is a considerable, but
not a preponderant, amount. These various
items break into their context, their style and
substance are not conformable to the style and
substance of the Oracles, which (as we shall see)
are reasonably attributed to Jeremiah, but they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
so closely resemble those of other writings from
the eve of the Return from Exile or from after
the Return that they seem to be based on the
latter. In any case they reflect the situation and
feelings of Israel in Babylonia about 540 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span>
Some find place in our Book among the earlier
Oracles of Jeremiah,<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> others in his
later,<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> but the
most in the group of Oracles on Foreign Nations.<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>
And, finally, there are the long extracts from the
Second Book of Kings, bringing, as I have said,
the history down to at least 561.<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All these, then, we lay aside, so far as our search
for Jeremiah himself and his doctrine is concerned,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and we do so the more easily that they are
largely devoid of the style and the spiritual value
of his undoubted Oracles and Discourses. They
are more or less diffuse and vagrant, while his
are concise and to the point. They do not reveal,
as his do, a man fresh from agonising debates
with God upon the poverty of his qualifications
for the mission to which God calls him, or upon
the contents of that mission, or upon his own
sufferings and rights; nor do they recount his
adventures with his contemporaries. They are
not the outpourings of a single soul but rather
the expression of the feelings of a generation or
of the doctrines of a school. We have in our
Bible other and better utterances of the truths,
questions, threats and hopes which they contain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But once more—in what remains of the Book,
what belongs to Jeremiah himself or to his time,
we have again proofs of compilation from more
sources than one. Some of this is in verse—among
the finest in the Old Testament—some in
prose orations; some in simple narrative. Some
Oracles are introduced by the Prophet himself,
and he utters them in the first person, some are
reported of him by others. And any chronological
or topical order lasts only through groups of
prophecies or narratives. Fortunately, however,
included among these are more than one account
of how the writing of them and the collection of
them came about.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 604-603 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span>, twenty-one, or it may have been
twenty-three, years after Jeremiah had begun to
prophesy, the history of Western Asia rose to a
crisis. Pharaoh Nĕcoh who had marched north
to the Euphrates was defeated in a battle for
empire by Nebuchadrezzar, son of the King
of Babylon. From the turmoil of nations which
filled the period Babylon emerged as that
executioner of the Divine judgments on the
world, whom Jeremiah since 627 or 625 had been
describing generally as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">out of the North</span></span>. His
predictions were justified, and he was able to put
a sharper edge on them. Henceforth in place of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">enemy from the North</span></span> Jeremiah could speak
definitely of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King of Babylon</span></span> and of his
people <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Chaldeans</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Ch. XXV we read accordingly that in that
year, 604-3, he delivered to the people of Jerusalem
a summary of his previous oracles. He told them
that the cup of the Lord's wrath was given into
his hand; Judah and other nations, especially
Egypt, must drink it and so stagger to their doom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But a spoken and a summary discourse was not
enough. Like Amos and Isaiah, Jeremiah was
moved to commit his previous Oracles to writing.
In Ch. XXXVI is a narrative presumably by
an eyewitness of the transactions it recounts, and
this most probably the scribe who was associated
with the Prophet in these transactions. Jeremiah
was commanded to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">take a roll of a book and write on
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
it all the words which</span></span> the Lord <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">had spoken to him
concerning Jerusalem</span><a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; font-style: italic; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a><span style="font-style: italic"> and Judah and all the nations
from the day</span></span> the Lord first <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">spake to him, in the days
of Josiah, even unto this day</span></span>. For this purpose he
employed Baruch, the son of Neriah, afterwards
designated the Scribe, and Baruch wrote on the
Roll to his dictation. Being unable himself to
enter the Temple he charged Baruch to go there
and to read the Roll on a fast-day <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in the ears of all
the people of Judah who have come in from their cities</span></span>.
Baruch found his opportunity in the following
December, and read the Roll from the New Gate
of the Temple to the multitude. This was
reported to some of the princes in the Palace
below, who sent for Baruch and had him read
the Roll over to them. Divided between alarm at
its contents and their duty to the king, they sent
Jeremiah and Baruch into hiding while they made
report to Jehoiakim. The king had the Roll read
out once more to himself as he sat in his room in
front of a lighted brasier, for it was winter. The
reading incensed him, and as the reader finished
each three or four columns he cut them up
and threw them on the fire till the whole was
consumed. But Jeremiah, in safe hiding with
Baruch, took another Roll and dictated again the
contents of the first; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and there were added besides
unto them many like words</span></span>.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The story has been questioned, but by very
few, and on no grounds that are perceptible
to common sense. One critic imagines that it
ascribes miraculous power to the Prophet in <span class="tei tei-q">“its
natural impression that the Prophet reproduces
from memory and dictates all the words which the
Lord has spoken to him.”</span><a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> There is no trace of
miracle in the story. It is a straight tale of
credible transactions, very natural (as we have
seen) at the crisis which the Prophet had reached.
No improbability infects it, no reflection of a later
time, no idealising as by a writer at a distance
from the events he recounts. On the contrary it
gives a number of details which only a contemporary
could have supplied. Nor can we
forget the power and accuracy of an Oriental's
memory, especially at periods when writing
was not a common practice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is, of course, more room for difference
of opinion as to the contents of each of the successive
Rolls, and as to how much of these contents
is included in our Book of Jeremiah. But
to such questions the most probable answer is
as follows.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There cannot have been many of the Prophet's
previous Oracles on the first Roll. This was read
three times over in the same day and was probably
limited to such Oracles as were sufficient for its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
practical purpose of moving the people of Judah
to repentance at a Fast, when their hearts would
be most inclined that way. But when the first
Roll was destroyed, the immediate occasion for
which it was written was past, and the second Roll
would naturally have a wider aim. It repeated
the first, but in view of the additions to it seems
to have been dictated with the purpose of giving
a permanent form to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the fruits of Jeremiah's
previous ministry. The battle of Carchemish had
confirmed his predictions and put edge upon
them. The destruction of the Jewish people was
imminent and the Prophet's own life in danger.
His enforced retirement along with Baruch lent
him freedom to make a larger selection, if not the
full tale, of his previous prophecies. Hence the
phrase <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">there were added many words like</span></span> those on
the first Roll.<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If such a Roll as the second existed in the care
of Baruch then the use of it in the compilation of
our Book of Jeremiah is extremely probable, and
the probability is confirmed by some features of the
Book. Among the Oracles which can be assigned
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to Jeremiah's activity before the fourth year of
Jehoiakim there is on the whole more fidelity to
chronological order than in those which were
delivered later, and while the former are nearly
all given without narrative attached to them, and
are reported as from Jeremiah himself in the first
person, the latter for the most part are embedded
in narratives, in which he appears in the third
person.<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Further let us note that if some of the Oracles
in the earlier part of the Book—after the account
of the Prophet's call—are undated, while the dates
of others are stated vaguely; and again, if some,
including the story of the call, appear to be tinged
with reflections from experiences of the Prophet
later than the early years of his career, then
these two features support the belief that the
Oracles were first reduced to writing at a distance
from their composition and first delivery—a belief
in harmony with the theory of their inclusion
and preservation in the Prophet's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> Roll.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us now turn to the biographical portions
of the Book. We have proved the trustworthiness
of Ch. XXXVI as the narrative of an eyewitness,
in all probability Baruch the Scribe, who for the
first time is introduced to us. But if Baruch wrote
Ch. XXXVI it is certain that a great deal more
of the biographical matter in the Book is from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his hand. This is couched in the same style; it
contains likewise details which a later writer could
hardly have invented, and it is equally free from
those efforts to idealise events and personalities,
by which later writers betray their distance from
the subjects of which they treat. It is true that,
as an objector remarks, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Book does not
contain a single line that claims to be written by
Baruch.”</span><a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> But this is evidence rather for, than
against, Baruch's authorship. Most of the biographical
portions of the Old Testament are
anonymous. It was later ages that fixed names to
Books as they have fixed Baruch's own to certain
apocryphal works. Moreover, the suppression of
his name by this scribe is in harmony with the
modest manner in which he appears throughout,
as though he had taken to heart Jeremiah's words
to him: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seekest thou great things for thyself? Seek
them not. Only thy life will I give thee for a prey in
all places whither thou goest.</span></span><a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> But there is still more
conclusive evidence. That Baruch had not been
associated with Jeremiah before 603-4 is a fair
inference from the fact that the Prophet had to
dictate to him all his previous Oracles. Now it is
striking that up to that year and the introduction
of Baruch as Jeremiah's scribe, we have few
narratives of the Prophet's experience and activity—being
left in ignorance as to the greater part of
his life under Josiah—and that these few narratives—of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his call, of his share in the propagation of
Deuteronomy, of the plot of the men of Anathoth
against him, of his symbolic action with his waist-cloth,
and of his visit to the house of the Potter—are
(except in the formal titles to some of them)
told in the first person by Jeremiah himself,<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a>
while from 604-3 onwards the biographical
narratives are much more numerous and, except
in three of them,<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a>
the Prophet appears only in
the third person. This coincidence of the first
appearance of Baruch as the Prophet's associate
with the start of a numerous series of narratives
of the Prophet's life in which he appears in the
third person can hardly be accidental.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such, then, are the data which the Book of
Jeremiah offers for the task of determining the
origins and authenticity of its very diverse contents.
After our survey of them, those of you
who are ignorant of the course of recent criticism
will not be surprised to learn that virtual agreement
now exists on certain main lines, while great
differences of opinion continue as to details—differences
perhaps irreconcilable. It is agreed
that the book is the result of a long and a slow
growth, stretching far beyond Jeremiah's time,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
out of various sources; and that these sources are
in the main three:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A. Collections of genuine Oracles and Discourses
of Jeremiah—partly made by himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
B. Narratives of his life and times by a contemporary
writer or writers, the principal, if not
the only, contributor to which is (in the opinion
of most) the Scribe Baruch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
C. Exilic and Post-Exilic additions in various
forms: long prophecies and narratives; shorter
pieces included among the Prophet's own Oracles;
and scattered titles, dates, notes and glosses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, there is also general agreement as to
which of these classes a very considerable number
of the sections of the Book belong to. There is not,
and cannot be, any doubt about the bulk of those
which are apparently exilic or post-exilic. It is
equally certain that a large number of the Oracles
are Jeremiah's own, and that the most of the
Narratives are from his time and trustworthy. But
questions have been raised and are still receiving
opposite answers as to whether or not some of the
Oracles and Narratives have had their original
matter coloured or expanded by later hands; or
have even in whole been foisted upon the Prophet
or his contemporary biographer from legendary
sources.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of these questions some, however they be
answered, so little affect our estimates of the
Prophet and his teaching that we may leave them
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
alone. But there are at least four of them on the
answers to which does depend the accurate
measure of the stature of Jeremiah as a man and
a prophet, of the extent and variety of his gifts
and interests, of the simplicity or complexity of
his temperament, and of his growth, and of his
teaching through his long ministry of over forty
years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These four questions are
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(1) The authenticity of the account of his call
in Ch. I.

(2) The authenticity of the account of his support
of the promulgation of Deuteronomy,
the Old Covenant, in Ch. XI.
</span></div>

(4) And an even larger question—Whether
indeed any of the prose Oracles attributed
to him in the Book are his, or
whether we must confine ourselves to
the passages in verse as alone his genuine
deliverances?
</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first three of these questions we may leave
for discussion to their proper places in our survey
of his ministry. The fourth is even more fundamental
to our judgment both of the Book and of
the Man; and I shall deal with it in the introduction
to the next lecture on <span class="tei tei-q">“The Poet Jeremiah.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From last lecture I left over to this the discussion
of a literary question, the answer to which is
fundamental to our understanding both of the
Book and of the Man, but especially of the Man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Book of Jeremiah has come to us with all
its contents laid down as prose, with no metrical
nor musical punctuation; not divided into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">stichoi</span></span>
or poetical lines nor marked off into stanzas or
strophes. Yet many passages read as metrically,
and are as musical in sound, and in spirit as poetic
as the Psalms, the Canticles, or the Lamentations.
Their language bears the marks that usually distinguish
verse from prose in Hebrew as in other
literatures. It beats out with a more or less
regular proportion of stresses or heavy accents.
It diverts into an order of words different from the
order normal in prose. Sometimes it is elliptic,
sometimes it contains particles unnecessary to the
meaning—both signs of an attempt at metre.
Though almost constantly unrhymed, it carries
alliteration and assonance to a degree beyond what
is usual in prose, and prefers forms of words more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sonorous than the ordinary. But these many and
distinct passages of poetry issue from and run into
contexts of prose unmistakable. For two reasons
we are not always able to trace the exact border
between the prose and the verse—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></span> because of
the frequent uncertainties of the text, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></span>
because the prose, like most of that of the prophets,
has often a rhythm approximating to metre. And
thus it happens that, while on the one hand much
agreement has been reached as to what Oracles
in the Book are in verse, and what, however
rhythmical, are in prose, some passages remain,
on the original literary form of which a variety
of opinion is possible. This is not all in dispute.
Even the admitted poems are variously scanned—that
is either read in different metres or, if in the
same metre, either with or without irregularities.
Such differences of literary judgment are due
partly to our still imperfect knowledge of the laws
of Hebrew metre and partly to the variety of
possible readings of the text. Nor is even that
all. The claim has been made not only to confine
Jeremiah's genuine Oracles to the metrical portions
of the Book, but, by drastic emendations of the
text, to reduce them to one single, exact, unvarying
metre.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These questions and claims—all-important as
they are for the definition of the range and character
of the prophet's activity—we can decide only
after a preliminary consideration of the few clear
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and admitted principles of Hebrew poetry, of their
consequences, and of analogies to them in other
literatures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Hebrew poetry there are some principles about
which no doubt exists. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></span>, its dominant feature
is Parallelism, Parallelism of meaning, which,
though found in all human song, is carried through
this poetry with a constancy unmatched in any
other save the Babylonian. The lines of a couplet
or a triplet of Hebrew verse may be Synonymous,
that is identical in meaning, or Supplementary
and Progressive, or Antithetic. But at least their
meanings respond or correspond to each other in
a way, for which no better name has been found
than that given it by Bishop Lowth more than a
century and a half ago, <span class="tei tei-q">“Parallelismus Membrorum.”</span><a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Second</span></span>, this rhythm of meaning is
wedded to a rhythm of sound which is achieved by
the observance of a varying proportion between
stressed or heavily accented syllables and unstressed.
That is clear even though we are unable
to discriminate the proportion in every case or even
to tell whether there were fixed rules for it; the
vowel-system of our Hebrew text being possibly
different from what prevailed in ancient Hebrew.
But on the whole it is probable that as in other
primitive poetries<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> there were no exact or rigorous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rules as to the proportion of beats or stresses in
the single lines. For the rhythm of sense is the
main thing—the ruling factor—and though the
effort to express this in equal or regularly proportioned
lines is always perceptible, yet in the
more primitive forms of the poetry just as in some
English folk-songs and ballads the effort did not
constantly succeed. The art of the poet was not
always equal to the strength of his passion or the
length of his vision, or the urgency of his meaning.
The meaning was the main thing and had
to be beat out, even though to effect this was to
make the lines irregular. As I have said in my
Schweich Lectures: <span class="tei tei-q">“If the Hebrew poet be so
constantly bent on a rhythm of sense this must
inevitably modify his rhythms of sound. If his
first aim be to produce lines each more or less
complete in meaning, but so as to run parallel to
its fellow, it follows that these lines cannot be
always exactly regular in length or measure of
time. If the governing principle of the poetry
requires each line to be a clause or sentence in
itself, the lines will frequently tend, of course
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
within limits, to have more or fewer stresses than
are normal throughout the poem.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there are other explanations of the metrical
irregularities in the traditional text of Hebrew
poems, which make it probable that these irregularities
are often original and not always (as they
sometimes are) the blunders of copyists. In all
forms of Eastern art we trace the influence of what
we may call Symmetriphobia, an aversion to
absolute symmetry which expresses itself in more
or less arbitrary disturbances of the style or
pattern of the work. The visitor to the East
knows how this influence operates in weaving and
architecture. But its opportunities are more frequent,
and may be used more gracefully, in the
art of poetry. For instance, in many an Old
Testament poem in which a single form of metre
prevails there is introduced at intervals, and especially
at the end of a strophe, a longer and
heavier line, similar to what the Germans call the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Schwellvers”</span> in their primitive ballads. And
this metrical irregularity is generally to the profit
both of the music and of the meaning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Further, the fact that poems, such as we now
deal with, were not composed in writing, but
were sung or chanted is another proof of the
possibility that the irregularities in their metre
are original. In the songs of the peasants of
Palestine at the present day the lines vary as
much as from two to five accents, and within the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
same metrical form from three to four; lines with
three accents as written will, when sung to music,
be stressed with four, or with four as written will
be stressed with five in order to suit the
melody.<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor are such irregularities confined to Eastern
or primitive poetry. In the later blank verse of
Shakespeare, broken lines and redundant syllables
are numerous, but under his hand they become
things of beauty, and <span class="tei tei-q">“the irregularity is the
foundation of the larger and nobler rule.”</span> To
quote the historian of English prosody—<span class="tei tei-q">“These
are quite deliberate indulgences in excess or defect,
over or under a regular norm, which is so pervading
and so thoroughly marked that it carries
them off on its wings.”</span><a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> Heine in his unrhymed
<span class="tei tei-q">“Nordseebilder,”</span> has many irregular lines—irregularities
suitable to the variety of the subjects
of his verse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, in relevance to the mixture of poetry
with prose in the prophetic parts of the Book of
Jeremiah, it is just to note that the early pre-Islamic
rhapsodists of Arabia used prose narratives
to illustrate the subjects of their chants;
that many later works in Arabic literature are
medleys of prose and verse; that in particular the

If I may offer a somewhat rough illustration,
the works of some Eastern poets are like canoe
voyages in Canada, in which the canoe now
glides down a stream and is again carried overland
by what are called portages to other streams or
other branches of the same stream. Similarly
these works have their clear streams of poetry,
but every now and again their portages of prose.
I may say at once that we shall find this true also
of the Book of Jeremiah.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All these phenomena, both of Eastern and of
Western poetry, justify us in regarding with
scepticism recent attempts whether to eliminate—by
purely arbitrary omissions and additions, not
founded on the evidence of the Manuscripts and
Versions—the irregularities in the metrical portions
of the Book of Jeremiah, or to confine the
Prophet's genuine Oracles to these metrical
portions, and to deny that he ever passed from
metre into rhythmical prose. And our scepticism
becomes stronger when we observe to what different
results these attempts have led, especially in
the particular form or forms of metre employed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Professor Duhm, for instance, confines our
prophet to one invariable form, that of the Qînah
or Hebrew Elegy, each stanza of which consists
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of four lines of alternately <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> accents or
beats; and by drastic and often quite arbitrary
emendation of the text he removes from this every
irregularity whether of defect or redundance in the
separate lines.<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> On the other hand Cornill concludes
that <span class="tei tei-q">“the metrical pieces in the book are
written throughout in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Oktastichs</span></span>,”</span> or eight lines
a piece, but admits (and rightly) that <span class="tei tei-q">“in the
metrical structure of the individual lines there
prevails a certain freedom, due to the fact that for
the prophet verse-making (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dichten</span></span>) was not an end
in itself.”</span> While he allows, as all must, that
Jeremiah frequently used the Qînah metre, he
emphasises the presence of the irregular line,
almost as though it were the real basis of the prophetic
metre.<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> Other modern scholars by starting
from other presuppositions or by employing
various degrees of the textual evidence of the
Versions, have reached results different from those
of Duhm and Cornill.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> But at the same time it is
remarkable how much agreement prevails as to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the frequent presence of the Qînah measure or its
near equivalent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To sum up: in view of the argument adduced
from the obvious principles of Hebrew verse and
of the primitive poetic practice of other nations—not
to speak of Shakespeare and some modern
poets—I am persuaded after close study of the
text that, though Jeremiah takes most readily
to the specific Qînah metre, it is a gross and
pedantic error to suppose that he confined himself
to this, or that when it appears in our Book it is
always to be read in the same exact form without
irregularities. The conclusion is reasonable
that this rural prophet, brought up in a country
village and addressing a people of peasants, used
the same license with his metres that we have
observed in other poetries of his own race. Nor
is it credible that whatever the purpose of his
message was—reminiscence, or dirge, or threat
of doom or call to repent, or a didactic purpose—Jeremiah,
throughout the very various conditions
of his long ministry of forty years, employed
but one metre and that only in its strictest form
allowing of no irregularities. This, I say, is not
credible.<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other question, whether in addition Jeremiah
ever used prose in addressing his people,
may be still more confidently answered. Duhm
maintains that with the exception of the letter to
the Jewish exiles in Babylonia,<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> the Prophet never
spoke or wrote to his people in prose, and that
the Book contains no Oracles from him, beyond
some sixty short poems in a uniform measure.
These Duhm alleges—and this is all that he finds
in them—reveal Jeremiah as a man of modest,
tender, shrinking temper, <span class="tei tei-q">“no ruler of spirits, a delicate
observer, a sincere exhorter and counsellor, a
hero only in suffering and not in
attack.”</span><a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> Every
passage of the Book, which presents him in any
character beyond this—as an advocate for the Law
or as a didactic prophet—is the dream of a later
age, definitely separable from his own Oracles not
more by its inconsistence with the temper displayed
in these than by its prose form; for in prose,
according to Duhm, Jeremiah never prophesied.
On the evidence we have reviewed this also is not
credible. That Jeremiah never passed from verse
to prose when addressing his people is a theory
at variance with the practice of other poets of his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
race; and the more unlikely in his case, who was
not only a poet but a prophet, charged with truths
heavier than could always be carried to the heart
of his nation upon a single form of folk-song. Not
one of the older prophets, upon whom at first he
leant, but used both prose and verse; and besides
there had burst upon his young ear a new style of
prophetic prose, rhythmical and catching beyond
any hitherto publicly heard in Israel. At least
some portions of our Book of Deuteronomy were
discovered in the Temple a few years after his call,
and by order of King Josiah were being recited
throughout Judah. Is it probable that he, whose
teaching proves him to have been in sympathy
with the temper and the practical purpose of that
Book, should never have yielded to the use of its
distinctive and haunting style?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is true that, while the lyrics which are
undoubtedly the prophet's own are terse, concrete,
poignant and graceful, the style of many—not
of all—of the prose discourses attributed
to him is copious, diffuse, and sometimes
cold. But then it is verse which is most
accurately gripped by the memory and firmly
preserved in tradition; it is verse, too, which
best guards the original fire. Prose discourses,
whether in their first reporting or in their subsequent
tradition more readily tend to dilate and
to relax their style. Nor is any style of prose
so open as the Deuteronomic to additions,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
parentheses, qualifications, needless recurrence
of formulas and favourite phrases, and the like.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Therefore in the selection of materials available
for estimating the range and character of
Jeremiah's activities as a prophet, we must not
reject any prose Oracles offered by the Book as
his, simply because they are in prose. This
reasonable caution will be of use when we come
to consider the question of the authenticity of
such important passages as those which recount
his call, or represent him as assisting in the
promulgation of Deuteronomy, and uttering the
Oracle on the New Covenant.<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, while it has been necessary to reject as
groundless the theory that Jeremiah was exclusively
a poet of a limited temper and a single
form of verse and was not the author of any
of the prose attributed to him, we must keep in
mind that he did pour himself forth in verse;
that it was natural for a rural priest such as
he, aiming at the heart of what was mainly a
nation of peasants, to use the form or forms
of folk-song most familiar to them<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href="#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a>—in fact
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the only literary forms with which they were
familiar; and that in all probability more of
the man himself comes out in the poetry than in
the prose which he has left to us. By his native
gifts and his earliest associations he was a poet
to begin with; and therefore the form and
character of his poetry, especially as revealing
himself, demand our attention.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From what has been said it is clear that we
must not seek too high for Jeremiah's rank as a
poet. The temptation to this—which has overcome
some recent writers—is due partly to a
recoil from older, unjust depreciations of his
prophetic style and partly to the sublimity of the
truths which that mixed style frequently conveys.
But those truths apart, his verse was just that of
the folksongs of the peasants among whom he
was reared—sometimes of an exquisite exactness
of tone and delicacy of feeling, but sometimes
full both of what are metrical irregularities according
to modern standards, and of coarse images
and similes. To reduce the metrical irregularities,
by such arbitrary methods as Duhm's, may
occasionally enhance the music and sharpen the
edge of an Oracle yet oftener dulls the melody
and weakens the emphasis.<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> The figures again
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are always simple and homely, but sometimes
even ugly, as is not infrequent in the rural poetries
of all peoples. Even the dung on the pastures
and the tempers of breeding animals are as readily
used as are the cleaner details of domestic life and
of farming—the house-candle, the house-mill, the
wine skins, the ornaments of women, the yoke,
the plough, and so forth. And there are abrupt
changes of metaphor as in our early ballads, due
to the rush of a quick imagination and the crowd
of concrete figures it catches.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some of Jeremiah's verse indeed shows no
irregularity. The following, for instance, which
recalls as Hosea loved to do the innocence and
loyalty of Israel's desert days, is in the normal
Qînah rhythm of lines with alternately <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> accents each. The two first lines are rhymed,
the rest not.

Sometimes, too, a stanza of regular metre is
preceded or followed by a passionate line of
appeal, either from Jeremiah himself or from
another—I love to think from himself, added when
his Oracles were about to be repeated to the
people in 604-3. Thus in Ch. II. 31 we find the

One of the most striking is the narrative of the
Prophet's call, Ch. I. 4-19, which I leave to be
rendered in the next lecture. In Chap. VII. 28 ff.
we have, to begin with, two verses:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then these verses are followed by a prose tale of
the people's sins. Is this necessarily from a later
hand, as Duhm maintains, and not naturally from
Jeremiah himself?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again Chs. VIII and IX are a medley of lyrics
and prose passages. While some of the prose is
certainly not Jeremiah's, being irrelevant to the
lyrics and showing the colour of a later age, the
rest may well be from himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ch. XIV is also a medley of verse and prose.
After the Dirge on the Drought (which we take
later), comes a passage in rhythmical prose (verses
11-16), broken only by the metrical utterance of
the false prophets in verse 13:—

And now the measure changes to one of longer
irregular lines, hardly distinguishable from rhythmical

as from a later hand:—

Again in Ch. XV. 1-2, prose is followed by a
couplet, this by more prose (verses 3, 4) and this
by verse again (verses 5-9). But these parts are
relevant to each other, and some of Duhm's
objections to the prose seem inadequate and even
trifling. For while the heavy judgment is suitably
detailed by the prose, the following dirge is as
naturally in verse:—

And once more, in the Oracle Ch. III. 1-6 the first
verse, a quotation from the law on a divorced wife,
is in prose, and no one doubts that Jeremiah himself
is the quoter, while the rest, recounting

So much for the varied and often irregular
streams of the Prophet's verse and their interruptions
and connections by <span class="tei tei-q">“portages”</span> of prose.
Let us turn now from the measures to the substance
and tempers of the poetry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As in all folk-song the language is simple, but
its general inevitableness—just the fit and ringing
word—stamps the verse as a true poet's. Hence
the difficulty of translating. So much depends
on the music of the Hebrew word chosen, so much
on the angle at which it is aimed at the ear, the
exact note which it sings through the air. It is
seldom possible to echo these in another language;
and therefore all versions, metrical or in prose, must
seem tame and dull beside the ring of the original.
Before taking some of the Prophet's renderings of
the more concrete aspects of life I give, as even
more difficult to render, one of his moral reflections
in verse—Ch. XVII. 5 f. Mark the scarceness of
abstract terms, the concreteness of the figures:—

As here, so generally, the simplicity of the poet's
diction is matched by that of his metaphors, similes,
and parables. A girl and her ornaments, a man
and his waist-cloth—thus he figures what ought to
be the clinging relations between Israel and their
God. The stunted desert-shrub in contrast to
the river-side oaks, the incomparable olive, the
dropped sheaf and even the dung upon the fields;
the vulture, stork, crane and swift; the lion, wolf
and spotted leopard coming up from the desert or
the jungles of Jordan; the hinnying stallions and
the heifer in her heat; the black Ethiopian, already
familiar in the streets of Jerusalem, the potter and
his wheel, the shepherd, plowman and vinedresser,
the driver with his ox's yoke upon his shoulders;
the harlot by the wayside; the light in the home
and sound of the hand-mill—all everyday objects
of his people's sight and hearing as they herded,
ploughed, sowed, reaped or went to market in the
city—he brings them in simply and with natural
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

are never bald or uncouth, though in translation
they may sometimes sound so.

Like his fellow-prophets, whose moral atmosphere
was as burning as their physical summer,
who living on the edge of the desert under a
downright sun <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">drew breath</span></span>
(as Isaiah puts it) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in the
fear of the Lord</span></span> and saw the world in the blaze of
His justice, Jeremiah brings home to the hearts
of his people the truths and judgments, with
which he was charged, in the hard, hot realism
of their austere world. Through his verse we
see the barer landscapes of Benjamin and Judah
without shadow or other relief, every ugly detail
exposed by the ruthless noon, and beyond them
the desert hills shimmering through the heat.
Drought, famine, pestilence and especially war
sweep over the land and the ghastly prostrate
things, human as well as animal, which their
skirts leave behind are rendered with vividness,
poignancy and horror of detail.

Sometimes the terror foretold is nameless and

There this poem leaves the Doom, but in others
Jeremiah leaps in a moment from the vague and
far-looming to the near and exact. He follows a
line which songs of vengeance or deliverance often
take among unsophisticated peoples in touch with
nature. They will paint you a coming judgment
first in the figure of a lowering cloud or bursting
storm and then in the twinkling of an eye they
turn the clouds or the lightnings into the ranks
and flashing arms of invaders arrived. I remember
an instance of this within one verse of a negro
song from the time of the American Civil War:—

Jeremiah was born soon after 650 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span> of a
priestly house at Anathoth, a village in the
country of Benjamin near Jerusalem. Just before
his birth Egypt and the small states of Palestine
broke from allegiance to Assyria. War was
imminent, and it may have been because of some
hope in Israel of Divine intervention that several
children born about the time received the name
Yirmyahu—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yahweh hurls</span></span> or

are tokens of the family's loyalty to the God of
Israel, at a time when the outburst in Jewry of
a very different class of personal names betrays
on the part of many a lapse from the true faith,
and when the loyal remnant of the people were
being persecuted by King Manasseh. Probably
the family were descended from Eli. For
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Abiathar, the last of that descent to hold office as
Priest of the Ark, had an ancestral estate at
Anathoth, to which he retired upon his dismissal
by Solomon.<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a> The child of such a home would
be brought up under godly influence and in high
family traditions, with which much of the national
history was interwoven. It may have been from
his father that Jeremiah gained that knowledge of
Israel's past, of her ideal days in the desert, of
her subsequent declensions, and of the rallying
prophecies of the eighth century, which is manifest
in his earlier Oracles. Some have claimed a
literary habit for the stock of Abiathar.<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a> Yet the
first words of God to Jeremiah—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">before I formed thee
in the body I knew thee, and before thou camest forth
from the womb I hallowed thee</span></span><a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a>—as well as the
singular originality he developed, rather turn us
away from his family traditions and influence.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What is more significant, for its effects appear
over all his earlier prophecies, is the country-side
on which the boy was born and reared.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Anathoth, which still keeps its ancient name
Anata, is a little village not four miles north-north-east
of Jerusalem, upon the first of the
rocky shelves by which the central range of
Palestine declines through desert to the valley of
the Jordan. The village is hidden from the main
road between Jerusalem and the North, and lies
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on no cross-road to the East. One of its influences
on the spirit of its greatest son was its exposure
to the East and the Desert. The fields of
Anathoth face the sunrise and quickly merge into
the falling wilderness of Benjamin. It is the
same open, arid landscape as that on which
several prophets were bred: Amos a few miles
farther south at Tekoa, John Baptist, and during
His Temptation our Lord Himself. The tops of
the broken desert hills to the east are lower than
the village. The floor of the Jordan valley is not
visible, but across its felt gulf the mountains of
Gilead form a lofty horizon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The descending foreground with no shelter
against the hot desert winds, the village herds
straying into the wilderness, the waste and
crumbling hills shimmering in the heat, the open
heavens and far line of the Gilead highlands, the
hungry wolves from the waste and lions from the
jungles of Jordan are all reflected in Jeremiah's
poems:—

It was a nursery not unfit for one, who might
have been (as many think), the greatest poet of
his people, had not something deeper and wider
been opened to him, with which Anathoth was
also in touch. The village is not more than an
hour's walk from Jerusalem. Social conditions
change little in the East; then, as now, the traffic
between village and city was daily and close—country
produce taken to the capital; pottery,
salted fish, spices, and the better cloths brought
back in exchange. We see how the history of
Jerusalem may have influenced the boy. Solomon's
Temple was nearly four hundred years' old.
There were the city walls, some of them still
older, the Palace and the Tombs of the Kings—perhaps
also access to the written rolls of
chroniclers and prophets. Above all, Anathoth
lay within the swirl of rumour of which the
capital was the centre. Jerusalem has always
been a tryst of the winds. It gathers echoes
from the desert far into Arabia, and news blown
up and down the great roads between Egypt and
Damascus and beyond to the Euphrates; or when
these roads are deserted and men fear to leave
their villages, news vibrating as it vibrates only
in the tremulous East, from hamlet to hamlet and
camp to camp across incredible spaces. As one
has finely said of a rumour of invasion:—

After a period of peace, and as Jeremiah was
growing to manhood, such rumours began to
blow south again from the Euphrates. Some
thirteen years or so earlier, Asshurbanipal, the
Sardanapalus of the Greeks, had accomplished
the last Assyrian conquest in Palestine, 641 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and for an interval the land was quiet. But
towards 625 word came that the Medes were
threatening Nineveh, and, though they were repelled,
in that year Asshurbanipal died and
Nabopolassar of Babylon threw off the Assyrian
yoke. Palestine felt the grasp of Nineveh relax.
There was a stir in the air and men began to
dream. But quick upon hope fell fear. Hordes
of a new race whom—after the Greeks—we call
Scythians, the Ashguzai of the Assyrian monuments,
had half a century before swarmed over
or round the Caucasus, and since then had been
in touch, and even in some kind of alliance, with
the Assyrians. Soon after 624 they forced the
Medes to relinquish the siege of Nineveh. They
were horsemen and archers, living in the saddle,
and carrying their supplies behind them in wagons.
After (as it seems) their effective appearance at
Nineveh, they swept over the lands to the south,
as Herodotus tells us;<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href="#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a> and riding by the Syrian

after the young prophet's call in 627-6. In
short, the world, and especially the North, was
(to use Jeremiah's word) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">boiling</span></span> with events
and possibilities of which God alone knew the
end. Prophets had been produced in Israel from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
like conditions in the previous century, and now
after a silence of nigh seventy years, prophets
were again to appear: Zephaniah, Nahum,
Habakkuk, and Jeremiah.

For these northern omens conspired with
others, ethical and therefore more articulate,
within Judah herself. It was two generations
since Isaiah and Hezekiah had died, and with
them the human possibilities of reform. For
nearly fifty years Manasseh had opposed the
pure religion of the prophets of the eighth
century, by persecution, by the introduction of
foreign and sensual cults, and especially by reviving
in the name of Israel's God<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a> the ancient
sacrifice of children, in order to propitiate His
anger. Thus it appears that the happier interests
of religion—family feasts, pieties of seed-time
and harvest, gratitude for light, fountains and
rain, and for good fortune—were scattered among
a host both of local and of foreign deities; while
for the God of Israel, the God of Abraham,
Moses and Isaiah, the most horrible of superstitious
rites were reserved, as if all that His
people could expect of Him was the abatement of
a jealous and hungry wrath.

At last with the overthrow of Manasseh's successor,
Amon, signs of a dawn appeared. The
child of eight years who was heir to the throne
was secured, perhaps through his mother's influence,
by a party in Court and Temple that
had kept loyal to the higher faith; and the people,
probably weary of the fanatic extravagance of
Manasseh, were content to have it so.

The young King Josiah, who to the end was to
prove himself worthy of his training, and the
boy in the priest's home at Anathoth were of an
age: a fact not to be omitted from any estimate
of the influences which moulded Jeremiah in his
youth. But no trace of this appears in what he
has left us; as a boy he may never have seen the
King, and to the close of Josiah's reign he seems
to have remained too obscure to be noticed by
his monarch; yet at the last he has only good to
say of Josiah:—

In the latter for four hundred years no deity of
the land had been worshipped save Yahweh, and
He in no material form. It would be easy to remove
from the streets of Jerusalem any recently
introduced Baals and possibly, as Assyria's sovereignty
relaxed, the worship of the Host of Heaven.
But beyond Jerusalem the task was more difficult.
Every village had the shrine of a deity before the
God of Israel came to the land. The names of
these local Baalîm, or Lords, had mostly vanished,<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a>
and Israel claimed the rural sanctuaries for
Yahweh. But the old rites, with the old conceptions
of deity attached to them, seem to have
been transferred to Him by the ignorant worshippers,
till instead of one Yahweh—one Lord—unique
in character and in power, there were as
many as there had been Baalîm, and they bore the
same inferior and sometimes repulsive characters.
We cannot exaggerate this division of the Godhead
into countless local forms:—

This dissipation of the national mind upon
many deities was reflected in the nation's politics.
With no faith in One Supreme God the statesmen
of Judah, just as in Isaiah's earlier days, fluttered
between the great powers which were bidding
for the empire of the world. Egypt under
Psamtik's vigorous direction pressed north, flying
high promises for the restless vassals of Assyria.
But Assyria, though weakened, had not become
negligible. Between the two the anchorless policy
of Judah helplessly drifted. To use Jeremiah's
figure, suitable alike to her politics and her religion,
she was a faithless wife, off from her
husband to one paramour after another.

All this was chaos worse than the desert that
crumbled before Anathoth, a tragedy more bitter

behind. What had God to say? It was a singular
mark of Israel, that the hope of a great prophet
never died from her heart. Where earnest
souls were left they prayed for his coming and
looked for the Word of the Lord by him more
than they who wait for the morning. The same

dictate the first words of the Lord to him till some
twenty-three years after he heard them, when it
was possible and natural for him to expand them
in terms of his intervening experience. And we
must remember the summary bent of the Hebrew
mind—how natural it was to that mind to describe
processes as if they were acts of a day, done by a
fiat as in the story of the Creation; or to state a
system of law and custom, which took centuries
to develop, as though it were the edict of a single
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lawgiver and all spoken at once, when the
development entered on a new and higher stage,
as we see in the case of Deuteronomy and its
attribution to Moses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet the forebodings at least of a task so vast as
that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prophet to the nations</span></span> were anything but
impossible to the moment of Jeremiah's call;
for the time surged, as we have seen, with the
movements of the nations and their omens for his
own people. Indeed it would have been strange
if the soul of any prophet, conscious of a charge
from the Almighty, had not the instinct, that as
the meaning of this charge was gradually unfolded
to him, it would reveal, and require from him
the utterance of, Divine purposes throughout a
world so full even to the uninspired eye of the
possibilities both of the ruin of old states and of
the rise of new ones—a world so close about his
own people, and so fraught with fate for them,
that in speaking of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></em> he could not fail to speak
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole of it</span></em> also. If at that time a Jew had
at all the conviction that he was called to be a
prophet, it must have been with a sense of the
same responsibilities, to which the older prophets
had felt themselves bound: men who knew themselves
to be ministers of the Lord of Hosts, Lord
of the Powers of the Universe, who had dealt not
with Israel only but with Moab and Ammon
and Aram, with Tyre and the Philistines and
Egypt, and who had spoken of Assyria herself as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
His staff and the rod of His judgment. Jeremiah's
three contemporaries, Ṣephaniah, Nahum and
Habakkuk, all deal with the foreign powers of their
day—why should he in such an age not have been
conscious from the first that his call from the Lord
of Hosts involved a mission as wide as theirs? I
am sure that if we had lived with this prophet
through his pregnant times, as we have lived
through these last ten years and have been compelled
to think constantly not of our own nation
alone—concentrated as we had to be on our duties
to her—but of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the nations of the world as
equally involved in the vast spiritual interests at
stake, we should have no difficulty in understanding
how possible and natural it was for Jeremiah
to hear his mission <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to the nations</span></em> clearly indicated
in the very moment of his call.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And in fact Jeremiah's acknowledged Oracles—some
of them among his earliest—travel far beyond
Judah and show not merely a knowledge of, and
vivid interest in, the qualities and fortunes of other
peoples, but a wise judgment of their policies and
therefore of what should be Judah's prudent
attitude and duty towards them. For long
before his call she had been intriguing with Egypt
and Assyria.<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a> Just then or immediately later the
Scythians, after threatening the Medes, were
sweeping over Western Asia as far as the frontier
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Egypt, and in his Scythian songs Jeremiah<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a>
shows an intimate knowledge of their habits. In
his Parable of the Potter (for which unfortunately
there is no date) he declares God's power to
mould or re-mould <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> nation.<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href="#note_122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a> And Baruch,
writing of Jeremiah's earlier ministry, says that
he spoke <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concerning all nations</span></em>.<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No wonder that Jeremiah shrank from such a
task: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ah, Lord God, I know not to speak, I am too
young.</span></span><a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> His excuse is interesting. Had he not
developed his gift for verse? Or, conscious
of its rustic simplicity, did he fear to take the
prophet's thunder on lips, that had hitherto moved
only to the music of his country-side? In the
light of his later experience the second alternative
is not impossible. When much practice must have
made him confident of his art as a singer, he tells
us how burning he felt the Word of the Lord to
be. But whatever was the motive of his reluctance
it was overcome. As he afterwards said:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To this also objection has been taken as still more
incredible in the spiritual experience of so youthful
a rustic. It has been deemed the exaggeration
of a later age, and described as the <span class="tei tei-q">“gigantic
figure”</span> of a <span class="tei tei-q">“plenipotentiary to the nations,”</span>
utterly inconsistent with the modest singer of
the genuine oracles of Jeremiah, <span class="tei tei-q">“a hero only in

strains the meaning of the passage. According
to this Jeremiah is to be the carrier of the Word
of the Lord. That Word, rather than the man
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
himself, is the power <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to pull up and tear down and

Hebrew prophet received without an instinct of
its world-wide range and its powers of both
destruction and creation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two visions follow. To appreciate the first we
must remember the natural anxiety of the prophets
when charged with pronouncements so
weighty and definite. The Word, the ethical
purpose of God for Israel was clear, but how was
it to be fulfilled? No strength appeared in the
nation itself. The party, or parties, loyal to the
Lord had been in power a dozen years and
effected little in Jerusalem and nothing beyond.
The people were not stirred and seemed hopeless.
Living in a village where little changed through
the years, but men followed the habits of their
fathers, Jeremiah felt everything dead. Winter
was on and the world asleep.
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Then the Word of the Lord came to me
saying, What art thou seeing, Jeremiah;
and I said, I am seeing the branch of an
almond tree. And the Lord said to me,
Well hast thou seen, for I am awake over
My Word to perform it.
</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Hebrew for almond tree is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">shākēdh</span></span>, which
also means <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">awakeness</span></span> or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">watchfulness</span></span>,<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a> and the

Lord was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">awake</span></em> or was
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">watchful</span></em>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">shōkēdh</span></span>—the
difference only of a vowel. In that first token of
spring which a Palestine winter affords, the Prophet
received the sacrament of his call and of the
assurance that God was awake! That the sacrament
took this form was natural. That of Isaiah
of Jerusalem was the vision of a Throne and an
Altar. That of Ezekiel, the exile, shone in the
stormy skies of his captivity. This to the prophet
of Anathoth burst with the first blossom on his
wintry fields. The sense of unity in which he
and his people conceived the natural and spiritual
worlds came to his help; neither in the one world
nor in the other did God slumber. God was
watching.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Second Vision needs no comment after
our survey of the political conditions of the time.
The North held the forces for the fulfilling of the
Word. The Vision is followed by a charge to
the Prophet himself.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jeremiah was silenced and went forth to his
ministry—the Word upon his lips and the Lord
by his side.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two further observations are natural.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></span>, note the contrast between the two
Visions—the blossoming twig and the boiling
caldron brewing tempests from the North. Unrelated
as these seem, they symbolise together
Jeremiah's prophesying throughout. For in fact
this was all blossom and storm, beauty and terror,
tender yearning and thunders of doom—up to the
very end. Or to state the same more deeply:
while the caldron of the North never ceased boiling
out over his world—consuming the peoples,
his own among them, and finally sweeping him
into exile and night—he never, for himself or for
Israel, lost the clear note of his first Vision, that
all was watched and controlled. There is his
value to ourselves. Jeremiah was no prophet of
hope, but he was the prophet of that without
which hope is impossible—faith in Control—that
be the times dark and confused as they may, and
the world's movements ruthless, ruinous and
inevitable, God yet watches and rules all to
the fulfilment of His Will—though how we see
not, nor can any prophet tell us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Second</span></span>, note how the story leaves the issue, not
with one will only, but with two—God's and the
Man's, whom God has called. His family has
been discounted, his people and their authorities,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
political and religious, are to be against him. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></em>
is to stand up and speak, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></em> is not to let himself
be dismayed before them, lest God make him dismayed.
Under God, then, the Individual becomes
everything. Here, at the start of his ministry,
Jeremiah has pressed upon him, the separateness,
the awful responsibility, the power, of the Single
Soul. We shall see how the significance of this
developed not for himself only, but for the whole
religion of Israel.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></span>, His Earliest Oracles, which reflect the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must keep in mind that the Prophet did not
dictate his early Oracles till the year 604-03, and
that he added to them on the Second Roll <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">many

of Western Asia.

These bear few marks of the later date at which
they were dictated by Jeremiah—in fact only a
probable reference to Egypt's invasion of Palestine
in 608, Ch. II. 16, and part, if not all, of Ch. III.
6-18. The general theme is a historical retrospect—Israel's
early loyalty to her God, and her subsequent
declension to the worship of other gods,
figured as adultery; along with a profession of
penitence by the people, to which God responds
by a stern call to a deeper repentance and
thorough reform; failing this, her doom, though
vaguely described as yet, is inevitable. The
nation is addressed as a whole at first in the
second person singular feminine, but soon also
in the plural, and the plural prevails towards the
end. The nation answers as a whole, sometimes
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></em> but sometimes also as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">We</span></em>.

Before expounding the truths conveyed by
these early Oracles it is well to translate them in
full, for though not originally uttered at the same
time, they run now in a continuous stream of

denying the whole of this passage to Jeremiah,
whether because it is in prose or because it treats
of Northern Israel as well as Judah.<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> But on
parts of it the colours are distinctly of a period
later than that of the Prophet. All the rest of
the Oracles may be taken to be from himself.
Duhm after much hesitation has come to doubt
the genuineness of Ch. II. 5-13, but his suspicions
of deuteronomic influence seem groundless, and
even if they were sound they would be insufficient
for denying the verses to Jeremiah.<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href="#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a>

From his call the Prophet went forth, as we
saw, with a heavy sense of the responsibility and
the power of the single soul, so far as he himself
was concerned; and while we study his ministry
we shall find him coming to feel the same for
each of his fellow-men. But in these his earliest
utterances he follows his predecessors, and
especially Hosea, in addressing his people as a
whole, and treating Israel as a moral unit from
the beginning of her history to the moment of
his charge to her. He continues the figures
which Hosea had used. Long ago in Egypt God
chose Israel for His child, for His bride, and led
her through the desert to a fair and fruitful land
of her own. Then her love was true. The term
used for it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ḥeṣedh</span></span>, is more than an affection; it is
loyalty to a relation. To translate it but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kindness</span></span>
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mercy</span></span>, as is usually done, is
wrong—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">troth</span></span> is

Upon the unsown land there were no rival
gods. But in fertile Canaan the nation encountered
innumerable local deities, the Baalîm,
husbands of the land, begetters of its fruits and
lords of its waters. We conceive how tempting
these Baalîm were both to the superstitious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prudence of tribes strange to agriculture and
anxious to conciliate the traditional powers
thereof; and to the people's passions through the
sensuous rites and feasts of the rural shrines.
Among such distractions Israel lost her innocence,
forgot what her own God was or had done for
her, and ceased to enquire of Him. Hence her
present vices and misery in contrast with her
early troth and safety. Hence the twin evils
of the time—on the one hand the nation's trust
in heathen powers and silly oscillation between
Egypt and Assyria; on the other the gross
immoralities to which the Baals had seduced its
sons. There was a double prostitution, to gods
and to men, so foul that the young prophet uses
the rankest facts in the rural life which he is
addressing in order to describe it.

This was so, not only because He was their
ancestral God—though such an apostasy was
unheard of among the nations—but because He
was such a God and had done so much for them;
because from the first He had wrought both with

after had neither character nor efficiency—mere
breaths, mere bubbles!

The nerve of the faith of the prophets was this
memory—that their God was love and in love
had wrought for His people. The frequent
expression of this by the prophets and by
Deuteronomy, the prophetic edition of the Law,
is the answer to those abstractions to which some
academic moderns have sought to reduce the
Object of Israel's religion—such as, <span class="tei tei-q">“a tendency
not ourselves that makes for righteousness.”</span>
The God of Israel was Righteous and demanded
righteousness from men; but to begin with He
was Love which sought their love in return.
First the Exodus then Sinai; first Redemption
then Law; first Love then Discipline. Through
His Deeds and His Word by the prophets He
had made all this clear and very plain.

Jeremiah has prefaced this Divine challenge with
a passionate exclamation in prose—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">O

have said) I like to think was added to his earlier

Yet the fervency with which he pleads the
Divine Love reveals a heart of hunger, if hardly
of hope, for his nation's repentance. Indeed apart
from his own love for them he could not have
followed Hosea so closely as he does at this stage
of his career, without feeling some possibility of
their recovery from even this, their awful worst;
and his ear strains for a sign of it. Like Hosea
he hears what sounds like the surge of a national
repentance<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a>—was it when Judah listened to the

pleadings and warnings of the discovered Book
of the Law and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">all the people stood to the Covenant</span></span>?
But he does not say whether he found
this sincere or whether it was merely a shallow
stir of the feelings. Probably he suspected the
latter, for in answer to it he gives not God's
gracious acceptance, but a stern call to a deeper
repentance and to a thorough trenching of their
hearts.

In this answer there is awfulness but not final
doom. The affirmation of a man's dread responsibility
for his fate implies, too, the liberty
to change his ways. In the dim mystery of the
heart freedom is clear. Similarly, and even
more plainly, is this expressed in the earlier
call to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">break up the fallow-ground</span></span>. This implies
that beneath those surfaces of the national life,
whether of callous indifference on the one hand
or of shallow feeling on the other, there is soil
which, if thoroughly ploughed, will be hospitable
to the good seed and fit to bring forth fruits
meet for repentance. Human nature even at
its worst has tracts other than those on which
there has been careless sowing among thorns,
moral possibilities below those of its abused
or neglected surfaces. Let us mark this depth,
which the Prophet's insight has already reached.
Much will come out of it; this is the matrix
of all developments by himself and others of
the doctrine of man and his possibilities under
God. And for all time the truth is valid that
many spoiled or wasted lives are spoiled or wasted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The following series of brief poems unfold the
panic actually caused, or to the Prophet's imagination
likely to be caused, in Judah by the advance
of these marauding hordes, and clearly reflect
their appearance and manner of raiding. It is
indeed doubtful that Judah was visited by the
Scythians, who appear to have swept only the
maritime plain of Palestine. And once more we
must remember that when the Prophet dictated
his early Oracles to Baruch for the second time
in 604, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">added to them many more like
words</span></span>,<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href="#note_204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a>
the impending enemy from the North was no
longer the Scythians but Nebuchadrezzar and his
Chaldeans; for this will explain features of the
poems that are not suited to the Scythians and
their peculiar warfare, which avoided the siege
of fortified towns but kept to the open country
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the ruin of its villages and fields. Jeremiah
does not give the feared invaders a name. The
Scythians were utterly new to his world; yet
their name may have occurred in the poems as
originally delivered and have been removed in
604, when the Scythians were no longer a force
to be reckoned with.<a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href="#note_205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a>

which may be the addition of a later hand, but
is as probably Jeremiah's own; for the capital,
though not likely to be besieged by the Scythians,
was just as concerned with their threatened invasion
as the country folk, to whom, in the first

2. The Second Scythian Song is like the first,
prefaced by a double address, which there is no
reason to deny to Jeremiah. Jerusalem is named
twice in the song, and naturally, since the whole
land is threatened with waste and the raiders
come up to the suburbs of the capital. The
Prophet speaks, but as so often the Voice of the
Lord breaks through his own and calls directly
to the city and people (though the last line of
verse 12 may be a later addition). On the other
hand, the Prophet melts into his people; their
panic and pangs become his. This is one of the
earliest instances of Jeremiah's bearing of the
sins of his people and of their punishment.

4. The Fourth Scythian Song follows immediately,
also without introduction. The first four
couplets vividly describe the flight of the peasantry,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
actual or imagined, before the invaders. The rest
seems addressed to the City as though being
threatened she sought to reduce her foes with a
woman's wiles, only to find that it was not her
love but her life they were after, and so expired
at their hands in despair. All this is more suitable
to the Chaldean than to the Scythian invasion,
and may be one of the Prophet's additions in 604
to his earlier Oracles. However we take it, the
figure is of Jeremiah's boldest and most vivid.
The irony is keen.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next poem, Ch. V. 1-13, says little of the
Scythians, possibly only in verse 6, but details the
moral reasons for the doom with which they
threatened the people. It describes the Prophet's
search through Jerusalem for an honest, God-fearing
man and his failure to find one. Hence
the fresh utterance of judgment. Perjury and
whoredom are rife, with a callousness to chastisement
already inflicted. Some have relegated
Jeremiah's visit to the capital to a year after 621-20
when the deuteronomic reforms had begun
and Josiah had removed the rural priests to the
Temple.<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a>
But, as we have seen, Anathoth lay so
near to Jerusalem, and intercourse between them
was naturally so constant, that Jeremiah may well
have gained the following experience before he
left his village for residence in the city. The
position of the poem among the Scythian Songs,
along with the possible allusion to the Scythians
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in verse 6, suggests a date before 620. There is
no introduction.

5. The Fifth Song upon the Scythians, Ch. V.
15-17, besides still leaving them nameless,
emphasises their strangeness to Israel's world.
There was a common language in Western Asia,
Aramean, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lingua franca</span></span> of traders from Nineveh
to Memphis; and Jew, Assyrian and Egyptian conversed
in it. But the tongue of these raiders from
over the Caucasus was unintelligible. Yet how
they would set their teeth into the land! Mixed
with the verses which thus describe them are
others which suit not them but the Chaldeans and
must have been added by the Prophet in 604.
A people so new to the Jews might hardly have
been called by Jeremiah <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">an ancient nation, from of old
a nation</span></span>, and in fact these phrases are wanting in
the Greek version.

The last couplet is unsuitable to the Scythians,
incapable as they were of sieges and avoiding
fortified towns—though once they rushed
Askalon. It is probably, therefore, another of
the additions of 604 referring to the Chaldeans.
The prose which follows is certainly from the
Chaldean period, for it was not Scythians but
Chaldeans who threatened with exile the peoples
whom they overran.

There follows a poem, verses 20-31, that has
nothing to do with the Scythian series; and that
with the preceding prose, with which also it has no
connection, shows us what a conglomeration of
Oracles the Book of Jeremiah is. It seems as
though the compiler, searching for a place for it,
had seen the catch-word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">harvest</span></span> in the previous
Scythian song and, this one having the same word,
he had copied it in here. The Book shows signs
elsewhere of the same mechanical method. But
like all the Oracles this has for its theme the
foolish dulness of Israel to their God and His
Word, and the truth that it is their crimes which
are the cause of all their afflictions yet now not in
history but in Nature. There is no reason to doubt
that the verses are Jeremiah's, and nothing against
our dating them in the early years of his ministry.

6. In the Sixth Song on the Scythians, VI. 1-5,
which also is given without introduction, Jerusalem
is threatened—even Jerusalem to which in
the previous songs the country-folk had been
bidden to fly for shelter—and the foes are described
in the attempt to rush her, as they rushed Askalon
according to Herodotus. That they are represented
as faltering and no success is predicted for
them, and also that they are called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">shepherds</span></span>, are
signs that it is the Scythians, though still nameless,
who are meant in verses 3-5. The next
three verses, separately introduced, point rather to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a Chaldean invasion by their picture of besiegers
throwing up a mound against the walls, and may
therefore be one of the additions to his earlier
Oracles made by the Prophet, when in 604 the
enemy from the North was clearly seen to be
Nebuchadrezzar, with the siege-trains familiar
to us from the Assyrian and Babylonian monuments;
upon which are represented just such a
hewing of timber and heaping of mounds against
a city's walls.

This is the last of Jeremiah's Oracles on the

date—before 621-20. What knowledge of this
new people and their warfare the Prophet displays!

of the Lord of Hosts in threatening Judah with

This section of Jeremiah's earlier Oracles concludes
with one addressed to himself, Ch. VI. 27-30.
It describes the task assigned him during
the most of his time under Josiah, whether before
the discovery and promulgation of the Book of the
Law in 621-20, or subsequently to this while he
watched the nation's new endeavour to repent
and reform. During the years from 621-20 till
608 when Josiah was defeated and slain at
Megiddo, there can have been but little for him
to do except to follow, as his searching eyes and
detached mind alone in Israel could follow, the
great venture of Judah in obedience to the Book
of the Law. For this interval the outside
world had ceased to threaten Israel. The Assyrian
control of her was relaxed: the people
of God were free, and had their first opportunity
for over a century to work out their own
salvation.

Anathoth, however, lay so near Jerusalem that
even from his boyhood Jeremiah must have been
familiar with the life and trade of the capital; and
as his name is not mentioned in connection with
the discovery of the Law-Book on which the
reforms were based, and neither he nor his biographer
speaks of that discovery, it is probable
that as yet he had not entered upon residence in
the Temple-precincts. A natural occasion for the
migration of his family and himself would be upon
Josiah's disestablishment of the rural sanctuaries
and provision for their priests beside the priests

laws, including some peculiar to itself, have been
woven out of more than one form, and there are
two Introductions to the Book, each hortatory
and historical and each covering to some extent
the same ground as the other. We cannot tell
how much of this compilation was contained in
the discovered Book of the Law. But this Book
included certainly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> the laws of worship peculiar
to Deuteronomy, because the reforms which it
inspired carried out these laws, and probably
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> some of the denunciations which precede or
follow the laws, for such would explain the consternation
of the King when the Book was read
to him.<a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265" href="#note_265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Deuteronomy is fairly described as a fresh
codification of the ancient laws of Israel in the
spirit of the Prophets of the Eighth Century.
The Book is not only Law but Prophecy, in the
proper sense of this word, and a prophetic interpretation
of Israel's history. It not only restates
old and adds new laws but enforces the basal
truths of the prophets, and in this enforcement
breathes the ethical fervour of Amos and Isaiah
as well as Hosea's tenderness and his zeal for
education.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Deuteronomy has three cardinal doctrines: The
One God, The One Altar, and The One People.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></span>, The One God. Though slightly tinged
with popular conceptions of the existence of other
gods,<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href="#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a>
the monotheism of the Book is strenuously
moral and warmly spiritual. The God of Israel
is to be served and loved because He is Love—the
One and Only God not more by His Righteousness
and His Power than by His Grace, manifest
as all three have been throughout His dealings
with Israel. The worship of other gods is forbidden
and so is every attempt to represent Himself
in a material form. His ritual is purged of
foolish, unclean and cruel elements. Witchcraft
and necromancy are utterly condemned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Second</span></span>—and this is original to Deuteronomy—The
One Altar, at that time an inevitable corollary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
both to the need for purity in the worship of
God and to the truth of His Unity. The long
license of sacrifices at a multitude of shrines
had resulted not only in the debasement of His
worship, but in the popular confusion of Himself
with a number of local deities.<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href="#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a> The removal of
the high-places, the concentration of sacrifice
upon One Altar had, by the bitter experience of
centuries, become a religious and an ethical
necessity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Third</span></span>, The One People. Save for possible
proselytes from the neighbouring heathen, Israel
is alone legislated for—a free nation owning no
foreign king as it bows to no foreign deity, but
governing itself in obedience to the revealed Will
of its own God. This Will is applied to every
detail of its life in as comprehensive a system of
national religion as the world has known. And
thus next to devotion to the Deity comes pride
in the nation. Because of their possession of the
Divine Law Israel are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></em> righteous people and
wise above all others. The patriotism of the
Book must have been one cause of its immediate
acceptance by the people, when Josiah brought
it before them and upon it they made Covenant
with their God. Throughout the Book treats the
nation as a moral unit. It enforces indeed justice
as between man and man. It gives woman a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
higher position than is assumed for her by other
Hebrew codes. It cares for the individual poor,
stranger, debtor and dependent priest with a
humanity all its own, and it exhorts to the
education of children. Above all it forbids base
thoughts as well as base deeds. Yet, while thus
enforcing the elements of a searching personal
morality, Deuteronomy deals with the individual
only through his relations to the nation and the
national worship. The Book has no promise for
the individual beyond the grave. Nor is there
pity nor charity for other peoples nor any sense
of a place for them in the Divine Providence.
There is no missionary spirit nor hope for mankind
outside of Israel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Further it is due to the almost exclusively
national outlook and interest of the Book that it
has no guidance or comfort to offer for another
element of personal experience—question and
doubt. While it illustrates from the nation's
history the purifying discipline of suffering because
of sin it says nothing of the sufferings of
righteous individuals, but by the absoluteness of
its doctrines of morality and Providence suggests,
if indeed it does not inculcate, the dogma that
right-doing will always meet with prosperity and
wrong-doing with pain and disaster—a dogma
which provoked the thoughtful to scepticism, as
we shall see with Jeremiah himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, the fact that the Book, while superbly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
insistent upon justice, holiness and humanity,
lays equal emphasis on a definite ritual, with One
Altar and an exclusive system of sacrifices, tempted
the popular mind to a superstitious confidence in
these institutions. And while it was of practical
advantage to have the principles of the prophets
reduced to a written system, which could be
enforced as public law and taught to the young—two
ends on which the authors of Deuteronomy
are earnestly bent—there was danger of the people
coming thereby to trust rather in the letter than
in the spirit of the new revelation. Both these
dangers were soon realised. As Dr. A. B.
Davidson has said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pharisæism and Deuteronomy
came into the world on the same day.”</span>
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the Book discovered in the Temple
in 621-20 and accepted as Divine by King and
Nation. Modern efforts to connect Jeremiah with
its discovery and introduction to the Monarch,
and even with its composition, may be ignored.
Had there been a particle of evidence for this, it
would have been seized and magnified by the
legalists in Israel, not to speak of those apocryphal
writers who foist so much else on Jeremiah and
Baruch.<a id="noteref_268" name="noteref_268" href="#note_268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a>
That they have not even attempted
this is proof—if proof were needed—that Jeremiah,
the youthful son of a rural family, and probably
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
still unknown to the authorities in the Capital,
had nothing whatever to do either with the origins,
or with the discovery, of the Book of the Law or
with its presentation to the King by the priests of
the Temple.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet so great a discovery, so full a volume of
truth poured forth in a style so original and
compelling, cannot have left unmoved a young
prophet of the conscience and heart of Jeremiah.<a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href="#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a>
That he was in sympathy with the temper and
the general truths of Deuteronomy we need not
doubt. As for its ethics, its authors were of the
same school as himself and among their teachers
they had the same favourite, Hosea. In his
earliest Oracles Jeremiah had expressed the same
view as theirs of God's constant and clear guidance
of Israel and of the nation's obstinacy in relapsing
from this. His heart, too, must have hailed the
Book's august enforcement of that abolition of
the high places and their pagan ritual, which he
had ventured to urge from his obscure position
in Anathoth. Nor did he ever throughout his
ministry protest against the substitute which the
Book prescribed for those—the concentration of
the national worship upon a single sanctuary.
On the contrary in a later Oracle he looks
for the day when that shall be observed by all
Israel and the watchmen on Mount Ephraim shall
cry,

On the other hand, the emphasis which Deuteronomy
equally lays upon ethics and upon ritual,
and its absolute doctrines of morality and
Providence were bound to provoke questions in
a mind so restlessly questioning as his. Then
there was the movement of reform which followed
upon the appeal of the Book to the whole nation.
Jeremiah himself had called for a national repentance
and here, in the people's acceptance of the
Covenant and consent to the reforms it demanded,
were the signs of such a repentance. No opposition
appears to have been offered to those
reforms. The King who led them was sincere;
a better monarch Judah never knew, and his
reign was signalised by Jeremiah at its close as a
reign of justice when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">all was well</span></span>. Yet can we
doubt that the Prophet, who had already preached
so rigorous a repentance and had heard himself
appointed by God as the tester of His people,
would use that detached position jealously to
watch the progress of the reforms which the
nation had so hurriedly acclaimed and to test
their moral value?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In modern opinion of Jeremiah's attitude to the
discovered Law-Book there are two extremes.
One is of those who regard him as a legalist and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
throughout his career the strenuous advocate of
the Book and the system it enforced. The other
is of those who maintain that he had no sympathy
with legal systems or official reforms, and that
the passages in the Book of Jeremiah which allege
his assent to, and his proclamation of, the Deuteronomic
Covenant, or represent him as using the
language of Deuteronomy, are not worthy of
credit.<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href="#note_271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">271</span></span></a> Of these extremes we may say at once
that if with both we neglect the twofold character
of Deuteronomy—its emphasis now on ethics and
now on ritual—and again, if with both we
assume that Jeremiah's attitude to the Law-Book
and to the reforms it inspired never changed,
then the evidences for that attitude offered by the
Book of Jeremiah are inconsistent and we may
despair of a conclusion. But a more reasonable
course is open to us. If we keep in mind the two
faces of Deuteronomy as well as the doubtful
progress for many years of the reforms started
by it, and if we also remember that a prophet
like all the works of God was subject to growth;
if we allow to Jeremiah the same freedom to
change his purpose in face of fresh developments
of his people's character as in the Parable of the
Potter he imputes to his God; if we recall how
in 604 the new events in the history of Western
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Asia led him to adapt his earlier Oracles on the
Scythians to the Chaldeans who had succeeded
the Scythians as the expected Doom from the
North—then our way through the evidence becomes
tolerably clear, except for the difficulty of
dating a number of his undated Oracles. What
we must not forget is the double, divergent
intention and influence of Deuteronomy, and the
fact that Josiah's reformation, though divinely
inspired, was in its progress an experiment upon
the people, whose mind and conduct beneath it
Jeremiah was appointed by God to watch and to
test.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These considerations prepare us <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> for the
story in Ch. XI. 1-8 of Jeremiah's fervent assent
to the ethical principles of Deuteronomy and of
the charge to him to proclaim these throughout
Judah; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></em> for his later attitude to the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The story has its difficulties. It is undated;
it is followed by verses 9-17, apparently from the
reign of Jehoiakim; what the Prophet is called
to hear and gives his solemn assent to is generally
described as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">this Covenant</span></span>; and in verses 7 and 8
there is what may be a mere editorial addition
since the Greek Version omits it, which has led
some to assert the editorial character of the
whole. But for the reasons given above, there is
no cause to doubt the substantial truthfulness of
the story, unless with Duhm we were capable of
believing that Jeremiah never spoke in prose, nor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
can be conceived as, at any time in his life the
advocate of what was a legal as well as a prophetic
book. Of the first of these assertions we
have already disposed;<a id="noteref_276" name="noteref_276" href="#note_276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a> the second is met by the
fact that what Jeremiah was called to assent to
was not a legal programme but a spiritual covenant,
of which ethical obedience alone was stated
as the condition. In Josiah's reign what else
could <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">this Covenant</span></span> mean than the Covenant set
forth in the recently discovered Book of the Law
and solemnly avouched by the whole people?<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a>
That its essence was spiritual and ethical is expressed
in the Deuteronomic phrases which
follow, and the quotation of these is most relevant
to the occasion. Nor do the recollections, the
command and the promise which they convey go
beyond what Jeremiah had already enforced in
his earlier Oracles.<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a>

Therefore we may believe that, as recorded,
Jeremiah heard in the heart of Deuteronomy the
call of God, that he uttered his Amen to it; and
that, from his experience of the evils of the high-places,
he felt obliged, as he also records, to
proclaim <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">this Covenant</span></span> throughout Judah.<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279" href="#note_279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a>

In the same chapter as the charge to the Prophet
concerning <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">this Covenant</span></span> there is mention of a conspiracy
against his life by the men of Anathoth,
XI. 21. Some suppose that these were enraged
by his support of reforms which abolished rural
sanctuaries like their own. But his earlier denunciations
of such shrines, delivered independently
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

rouse his fellow-villagers against him as a traitor
to their local interests and pieties.

Another address, VII. 1-15, said to have been
delivered to all Judah, rebukes the people for
their false confidence in the Temple and their
abuse of it, and threatens its destruction. Editorial
additions may exist in both the Hebrew and
Greek texts of this address, but it contains phrases
non-deuteronomic and peculiar to Jeremiah, while
its echoes of Deuteronomy were natural to the
occasion. Except for a formula or two, I take the
address to be his own. Nor am I persuaded by
the majority of modern critics that it is a mere
variant of the Temple address reported in Ch.
XXVI as given <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in the beginning of the reign of
Jehoiakim</span></span>. Why may Jeremiah not have spoken
more than once on the same theme to the same, or
a similar effect? Moreover, the phrase <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We are
delivered!</span></span> VII. 10, which does not recur in XXVI,
suits the conditions before, rather than those after,
the Battle of Megiddo. For parallel with the
increased faith in the Temple, due mainly to the
people's consciousness of their obedience to the
Law-Book, was their experience of deliverance
from the Assyrian yoke. I am inclined, therefore,
to refer VII. 1-15 to the reign of Josiah, rather
than with XXVI to that of Jehoiakim.<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a> But,

of that sacredness. Their confidence in the
Temple is material and superstitious, fostered, we
may believe, by the peace they were enjoying and
their relief from a foreign sovereignty, as well as
by their formal observance of the institutions
which the Book prescribed. What had been
founded to rally and to guide a spiritual faith they
turned into a fetish and even to an <span class="tei tei-q">“indulgence”</span>
for their wickedness. The House, in which Isaiah
had bent beneath the seraphs' adoration of the
Divine Holiness, and, confessing his own and his
people's sin, had received from its altar the
sacrament of pardon and of cleansing, was by this
generation not only debased to a mere pledge of
their political security but debauched into a shelter
for sins as gross as ever polluted their worship
upon the high places. So ready, as in all other
ages, were formality and vice to conspire with
each other! Jeremiah scorns the people's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">trust</span></em> in
the Temple as utterly as he had scorned their
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">trust</span></em> (it is the same word) in the Baals or in Egypt
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Assyria. The change in the pivot of their
false confidence is to be marked. So much at least
had Deuteronomy effected—shifting their trust
from foreign gods and states to something founded
by their own God, yet leaving it material, and
unable to restrain them from bringing along with
it their old obdurate vices.

Whether, then, this address was delivered in
Josiah's reign or early in Jehoiakim's it affords no
reason for our denying it to Jeremiah. As God's
tester of the people he has been watching their response
to the Revelation they had accepted, and has
proved that their obedience was to the letter of this
and not to its spirit, that while they superstitiously
revered its institutions they shamelessly ignored
its ethics. For just such vices as they still
practised God Himself must take vengeance. As
those had deranged the very seasons and were
leading to the overthrow of the state,<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a> no one could
hope that the Temple would escape their consequences.
And there was that precedent of the
destruction of Israel's first sanctuary in Shiloh, the
ruins of which, as we have seen, lay not far from
Jeremiah's home at Anathoth.<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a>

Another Oracle, XI. 15, 16, also undated, seems,
like the last passage, best explained as delivered
by Jeremiah while he watched during the close
of Josiah's reign the hardening of the people's
trust in their religious institutions and felt its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
futility; or alternatively when that futility was
exposed by the defeat at Megiddo. It has, however,
been woven by some hand or other into a
passage reflecting the revival of the Baal-worship
under Jehoiakim (verse 17; its connection with
the prose sentence preceding is also doubtful).

The first of these verses repeats the charge of
VII. 2-11: the people use the Temple for their
sins. The word rendered <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mischief</span></span> is literally
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">devices</span></span>, and the meaning may be intrigues hatched
from their false ideas of the Temple's security.
But the word is mostly used of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">evil devices</span></span> and
here the Greek has <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">abomination</span></span>. As with their

Temple so with their vows and sacrifices. All
are useless because of their wickedness. The
nation must be punished. The second verse may
well have been uttered after the defeat at Megiddo,
or may be a prediction on the eve of that disaster
to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the branches</span></span> of the nation, which the nation as

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This leads to another and more difficult question.
Jeremiah has spoken doom on the Temple
and the Nation; has he come to doubt the Law-Book
itself or any part of it? As to that there
are two passages one of which speaks of a falsification
of the Law by its guardians, while the
other denies the Divine origin not only of the
deuteronomic but of all sacrifices and burnt
offerings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Torah</span></em>, so as to turn it to falsehood. The

some answer No, on the ground of Jeremiah's

that Jeremiah had in view those first essays in
writing of a purely priestly law-book, which resulted
during the Exile in the so-called Priests'
Code now incorporated in the Pentateuch. In
our ignorance both of the original form of Deuteronomy
and of the extent and character of the
activity of the scribes during the reign of Josiah
we might hesitate to decide among these possibilities
were it not for the following address
which there is no good reason for denying to
Jeremiah.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whether from Jeremiah or not, this is one of the
most critical texts of the Old Testament because
while repeating what the Prophet has already
fervently accepted,<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a> that the terms of the deuteronomic
Covenant were simply obedience to the
ethical demands of God, it contradicts Deuteronomy
and even more strongly Leviticus, in their repeated
statements that in the wilderness God
also commanded sacrifices. The issue is so grave
that there have been attempts to evade it. None,
however, can be regarded as successful. That
which would weaken the Hebrew phrase, rightly
rendered <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">concerning</span></span> by our versions, into
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">for the sake of</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in the interest of</span></span>
(as if all the speaker intended was that animal sacrifice was not the
chief end or main interest of the Divine legislation)
is doubtful philologically, nor meets the fact that
all the Hebrew codes assign an indispensable
value to sacrifice. Inadmissible also is the suggestion
that the phrase means <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">concerning the details
of</span></span>, for Deuteronomy and especially Leviticus emphasise
the details of burnt-offering and sacrifice.
Nor is the plausible argument convincing that
the Prophet spoke relatively, and meant only
what Samuel meant by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Obedience is better than sacrifice</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or Hosea by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Knowledge of God is more than
burnt-offerings</span></span>.<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a> Nor are there grounds for thinking
that the Prophet had in view only the Ten
Commandments; while finally to claim that he
spoke in hyperbole is a forlorn hope of an argument.
In answer to all these evasions it is enough
to point out that the question is not merely that
of the value of sacrifice, but whether during the
Exodus the God of Israel gave any charge concerning
sacrifice; as well as the fact that others
than Jeremiah had either explicitly questioned
this or implicitly denied it. When Amos, in
God's Name repelled the burnt-offerings of his
generation he asked, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Did ye bring unto Me sacrifices
and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O House of
Israel?</span></span> and obviously expected a negative answer.
And the following passages only render more
general the truth that Israel's God has no
pleasure at any time in the sacrifices offered to
Him, with the institution of which—the natural
inference is—He can have had nothing to do. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Will
the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten
thousands of rivers of oil. Shall I give my first-born
for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of
my soul? He hath declared to thee, O man, what is good:
and what doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly,
and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
And these two utterances in the Psalms: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shall I
eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? Offer
unto God thanksgiving and pay thy vows to the Most
High</span></span>; and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thou desirest not sacrifice else would I
give it, Thou delightest not in burnt-offering, The
sacrifices of God are a broken spirit</span></span>.<a id="noteref_300" name="noteref_300" href="#note_300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the accuracy of these assertions or implications
by a succession of prophets and psalmists
there is a remarkable body of historical evidence.
The sacrificial system of Israel is in its origins of
far earlier date than the days of Moses and the
Exodus from Egypt. It has so much, both of form
and meaning, in common with the systems of
kindred nations as to prove it to be part of the
heritage naturally derived by all of them from
their Semitic forefathers. And the new element
brought into the traditional religion of Israel at
Sinai was just that on which Jeremiah lays
stress—the ethical, which in time purified the
ritual of sacrifice and burnt-offering but had
nothing to do with the origins of this.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Therefore it is certain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> that Amos and
Jeremiah meant literally what they stated or
implicitly led their hearers to infer—God gave no
commands at the Exodus concerning burnt-offerings
and sacrifices—and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> that historically
they were correct. But, of course, their interest
in so saying was not historical but spiritual.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Their aim was practical—to destroy their generation's
materialist belief that animal sacrifice was
the indispensable part of religion and worship.
Still his way of putting it involves on the part of
Jeremiah a repudiation of the statements of
Deuteronomy on the subject. So far, then,
Jeremiah opposed the new Book of the Law.<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href="#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But with all this do not let us forget something
more. While thus anticipating by more than six
centuries the abolition of animal sacrifices,
Jeremiah, by his example of service and suffering,
was illustrating the substitute for them—the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">human</span></em> sacrifice, the surrender by man himself of
will and temper, and if need be of life, for the
cause of righteousness and the salvation of his
fellow-men. The recognition of this in Jeremiah
by a later generation in Israel led to the conception
of the suffering Servant of the Lord, and of
the power of His innocent sufferings to atone for
sinners and to redeem them.

<div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This starts a kindred point—and the last—upon
which Jeremiah offers, if not a contradiction, at
least a contrast and a supplement to the teaching
of Deuteronomy. We have noted the absoluteness—or
idealism—of that Book's doctrines of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Morality and Providence; they leave no room
for certain problems, raised by the facts of life.
But Jeremiah had bitter experience of those facts,
and it moved him to state the problems to God
Himself. He owns the perfect justice of God;
but this only makes his questioning more urgent.

We shall have to deal with these questions
and God's answer to them, when in a later lecture
we analyse Jeremiah's religious experience and
struggles. Here we only note the contrast which
they present to Deuteronomy—a contrast between
the Man and the System, between Experience and
Dogma, between the Actual and the Ideal. And,
as we now see, it was the System and the Dogma
that were defective and the Man and his Experience
of life that started, if not for himself yet for
a later generation, pondering his experience, the
solution of those problems, which against the
deuteronomic teaching he raised in brave agony
to God's own face.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such serious differences between Jeremiah and
Deuteronomy—upon the Law, the Temple, the
Sacrifices, and Doctrines of Providence and
Morality—suggest an important question with
regard to the methods of Divine Revelation under
the Old Covenant. Do they not prove that among
those methods there were others than vision or
intuition springing from the direct action of the
Spirit of God upon the spirits of individual men?
Are they not instances of the processes by which
to this day in the Providence of God truth
is sifted and ultimately beaten out—namely
debate and controversy between different minds
or different schools of thought, between earnest
supporters of various and often hostile opinions
in neither of which lies the whole of the truth?
The evidence for Revelation by Argument which
the Book of Jeremiah affords is not the least of
its contributions to the history and philosophy of
religion.

tragic close on the field of Megiddo—the Flodden
of Judah.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The year was 608 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span> Medes and Chaldeans
together had either taken, or were still besieging,
Nineveh; and Pharaoh Nĕcoh,<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a> eager to win
for Egypt a share of the crumbling Assyrian
Empire, had started north with a great army.
Marching by the coast he first took Gaza, and
crossing by one of the usual passes from
Sharon to Esdraelon,<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a> found himself opposed
near Megiddo by a Jewish force led by its king
in person. The Chronicler tells us that Nĕcoh
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sought to turn Josiah from his desperate venture:
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What have I to do with thee? I am come not against

The issue of so unequal a contest could not be
doubtful. The Jewish army was routed and
Josiah himself immediately slain.<a id="noteref_306" name="noteref_306" href="#note_306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At first sight, the courage of Josiah and his
small people in facing the full force of Egypt
seems to deserve our admiration, as much as did
the courage of King Albert and his nation in opposing
the faithless invasion of Belgium by the
Germans aiming at France. There was, however,
a difference. Nĕcoh was not invading
Judah, but crossing Philistine territory and a
Galilee which had long ceased to be Israel's.
Some suppose that since the Assyrian hold upon
Palestine relaxed, Josiah had gradually occupied
all Samaria. If this be so, was he now stirred by
a gallant sense of duty to assert Israel's ancient
claim to Galilee as well? We cannot tell.<a id="noteref_307" name="noteref_307" href="#note_307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a> But
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
what we may confidently assume is that, having
fulfilled by thirteen years of honest reforms his
own part of the terms of the Covenant, Josiah
believed that he could surely count on the Divine
fulfilment of the rest, and that some miracle would
bring to a righteous king and people victory over
the heathen, however more powerful the heathen
might be. He was only thirty-nine years of age.

The next King, Jehoiakim, another of Josiah's
sons, was set on the throne by Nĕcoh, who also
exacted a heavy tribute. What national disillusion!
The hopes falsely kindled upon the letter
of Deuteronomy lay quenched on Megiddo; and
the faithful servant of the Covenant had, in spite
of its promises as men would argue, been defeated
and slain in the flower of his life. Judah
had been released from the Assyrian yoke, only
to fall into the hands of another tyrant, her new
king his creature, and her people sorely burdened
to pay him. The result was religious confusion.
In at least a formal obedience to the deuteronomic
laws of worship, the people of the land continued
to resort to the Temple fasts and festivals.<a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href="#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a> But

thoughtful but not less bewildered, conceived
doubts of the worth of righteousness. And these
tempers were embittered by the cruel selfishness
of the new monarch and his reckless injustice.
To the taxes required for the tribute to Egypt
he added other exactions in order to meet his extravagance
in enlarging and adorning his palace.
The crime, with which Jeremiah charges him in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the following lines, is one to which small kings
in the East have often been tempted by their
contact with civilisations richer than their own.

Such a prophet to such a king must have been

There were other and more poisonous enemies.
We have found him, from the first, steadily seeing
through, and stoutly denouncing the great religious
orders—the priests, natural believers in the
Temple, with a belief, since Deuteronomy came
into their hands, more dogmatic and arrogant
than ever; and the professional prophets with
their shallow optimism that all was well for
Judah, and that her God could never bring upon
her the doom which Jeremiah threatened in His
Name. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Not He!</span></span> was their answer to him.
These two classes were in conspiracy, deluding
themselves and the people; in their trust upon
the letter of the Law, they had no sense, as he

This he bravely gave by making, in obedience
to God's call, public prediction of the ruin of the
Temple. It is uncertain whether Jeremiah did
so only once, as many think who read in Chs.
VII and XXVI reports of the same address, or
whether, as I am inclined to believe, the former
chapter reports an address delivered under Josiah,
and the latter the repetition of its substance in
the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim.<a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href="#note_315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a> However

XXVI. 1. In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim,
son of Josiah, came this word from the
Lord. 2. Thus saith the Lord, Stand in the
court of the Lord's House and speak unto all
Judah, all who come in to worship in the
Lord's House, all the words that I have
charged thee to speak to them; keep back
not a word. 3. Peradventure they will hearken
and turn every man from his evil way, and I
shall relent of the evil which I am purposing
to do to them because of the evil of their
doings. 4. And thou shalt say, Thus saith the
Lord: If ye will not obey Me to walk in My
Law, which I have set before you, [5] to hearken
to the words of My servants, the prophets
whom I am sending to you, rising early and
sending—but ye have not hearkened—[6] then

shall I render this House like Shiloh and this
City a thing to be cursed of all nations of the
earth.
7. And the priests and the prophets and all
the people heard Jeremiah speaking these
words in the House of the Lord. 8. And it was,
when Jeremiah finished speaking all that the
Lord had charged him to speak to all the
people, that the priests and the prophets</span><a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href="#note_317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> laid
hold on him saying, Thou shalt surely die!
9. Because thou hast prophesied in the Name
of the Lord saying, As Shiloh this House
shall be, and this City shall be laid waste
without a dweller. And all the people were
gathered to Jeremiah in the House of the
Lord.
10. When the princes of Judah heard of these
things they came up from the king's house to
the House of the Lord and took their seats
in the opening of the New Gate of the Lord's
House.</span><a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
11. Then said the priests and the

12. And Jeremiah said to the princes and to
all the people, The Lord hath sent me to
prophesy against this House and against this
City all the words which ye have heard. 13. So
now better your ways and your doings, and
hearken to the Voice of the Lord, that the
Lord may relent of the evil which He hath
spoken against you. 14. But as for me, here am
I in your hand! Do to me as is good and
right in your eyes. 15. Only know for sure that
if ye put me to death ye will be bringing
innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon
this City and upon her inhabitants; for in
truth the Lord did send me unto you to
speak in your ears all these words.
16. And the princes and all the people said to
the priests and the prophets, Not for this
man be sentence of death, because in the
Name of the Lord our God hath he spoken
to us.
17. Then arose some of the elders of the land
and said to all the assembly of the people.
18. There was Micaiah the Morasthite in the
days of Hezekiah, king of Judah, and he said
to all the people of Judah, Thus saith the
Lord:
Ṣion like a field shall be ploughed,
And Jerusalem be heaps,
And the mount of the House a mound of the jungle.

19. Did Hezekiah and all Judah put him to death?
Did they not fear the Lord and soothe the
Lord's face, and the Lord relented of the
evil He had uttered against them. Yet we
are about to do a great wrong upon our own
lives.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Several of its features lift this story to a place
among the most impressive in the Old Testament.
The priests and prophets on the one side and the
princes on the other both use the phrase, that
Jeremiah <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">spoke in the Name of the Lord</span></span>. But the
former quote it ironically, or in indignation at
the Prophet's claim, while the princes are obviously
impressed by his sincerity and apparently
their impression is shared by the people. There
could be no firmer measure of the pitch of personal
power to which Jeremiah has at last braced himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The promise of his Call is fulfilled. Sceptical,
fluid and shrinking as he is by nature, he stands
for this hour at least, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a strong wall and a fortress</span></span>,
by his clear conscience, his simple courage, and
his full surrender to whatever be in store for him.
How bravely he refuses to conciliate them!—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I
am in your hand, do to me as is right in your eyes.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, there is proof of a popular tradition and
conscience in Israel more sound than those of the
religious authorities of the nation. The people
remembered what their priests and prophets
forgot or ignored, and through their elders gave
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
utterance to it on the side of justice. In agreement
with them were the princes, the lay leaders
of the nation. To ecclesiastics of every age and
race this is a lesson, to give heed to <span class="tei tei-q">“the common
sense”</span> and to the public instinct for justice. And
on that day in Jerusalem these were called forth
by the ability of the people, commoners and
nobles alike, to recognise a real Prophet, an
authentic Speaker-for-God at once when they
heard him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The danger that Jeremiah faced and the source
from which it sprang are revealed by the fate
which befell another denouncer of the land in the
Name of the Lord. Of him, the narrator uses a
form of the verb <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to prophesy</span></span> different from that
which he uses of Jeremiah, thus guarding himself
from expressing an opinion as to whether the
man was a genuine prophet. This is a further

We are not told why, after the verdict of the

was needed. Yet the people were always fickle,
and the king who is not mentioned in connection
with Jeremiah's case, but as we see from Urijah's

the man to be turned by a popular verdict from
taking vengeance on the Prophet who had attacked

All this was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim</span></span>.
Before we follow Jeremiah himself through
the rest of that malignant and disastrous reign,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 625 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span> the successor of Asshurbanipal upon
the tottering throne of Assyria had found himself
compelled to acknowledge Nabopolassar the
Chaldean as nominally viceroy, but virtually king,
of Babylon.<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a> The able chief of a vigorous race,
Nabopolassar bided his time for a vaster sovereignty,
and steadily this came to him. The
Medes, twice baffled in their attempts on Nineveh,<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a>
made terms with him for a united assault on the
Assyrian capital and for the division of its empire.
To that assault Nineveh fell in 612 or 606,<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href="#note_326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a> and
with her fall Assyria disappeared from among
the Northern Powers. Whatever part of the
derelict empire the Medes may have secured,
Mesopotamia remained with the Chaldeans who
doubtless claimed as well all its provinces south
of the Euphrates. But, as we have seen, Nĕcoh
of Egypt had already overrun these and battle
between him and the Chaldeans became imminent.
Their armies met in 605-4 at Carchemish on
The River. Nĕcoh was defeated by Nebuchadrezzar,
son of Nabopolassar, and driven south to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his own land. Egypt had failed; and the northern
caldrons, as Jeremiah from the first predicted,
again boiled with the fate of Judah and her
neighbours. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Foe</span></span>, though no longer the
Scythian of his early expectations, was still <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">out of

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By 602, if not before, Nebuchadrezzar, having
succeeded his father as King of Babylon, carried
his power to the coasts of the Levant and the
Egyptian border. Judah was his vassal, and for
three years Jehoiakim paid him tribute, but then
defaulted, probably because of promises from
Egypt after the fashion of that restless power.
As if not yet ready to invade Judah in force,
Nebuchadrezzar let loose upon her, along with
some of his own Chaldeans, troops of Moabites,
Ammonites and Arameans. Soon afterwards
Jehoiakim died and was succeeded by his son
Jehoiachin, a youth of eighteen, who appears to
have maintained his father's policy; for in 598, if
not 597, Nebuchadrezzar came up against Jerusalem,
which forthwith surrendered, and the king,
his mother and wives, his courtiers and statesmen
were carried into exile, with the craftsmen and
smiths and all who were <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">apt for war; none remained

Throughout these convulsions of her world,
this crisis in the history of Judah herself, Jeremiah
remains the one constant, rational, and
far-seeing power in the national life. But at
what terrible cost to himself! His experience
is a throng of tragic paradoxes. Faithful to his
mission, every effort he makes to rouse his people
to its meaning is baffled. His word is signally
vindicated by the great events of the time, yet
each of these but tears his heart the more as he
feels it bringing nearer the ruin of his people.
His word is confirmed, but he is shaken by
doubts of himself, his utterance of which is in
poignant contrast to his steadfast delivery of his
messages of judgment. No prophet was at once
more sure of his word and less sure of himself;
none save Christ more sternly denounced his
people or upon the edge of their doom more
closely knit himself to them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a staggering world, and the one man who
has its secret is shaken to despair about himself.
Yet the Word with which he is charged not
only fulfils itself in event after event but holds
its distracted prophet fast to the end of his abhorred
task of proclaiming it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The cardinal event was Nebuchadrezzar's
victory over Nĕcoh at Carchemish in 605 or 604
with its assurance of Babylonian, not Egyptian,
supremacy throughout Western Asia. Such confirmation
of the substance of Jeremiah's prophecies
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the past twenty-three years was that Divine
signal which flashed on him to reduce those
prophecies to writing and have them recited to
the people by Baruch. We have already followed
the story in Ch. XXXVI of how this was
done<a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href="#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a> and
of the consequences—the communication
of the Roll to the princes and by them to
the king, the king's burning of the Roll piece by
piece as he heard it read, his order for the arrest
of Jeremiah and Baruch, their escape into hiding,
and their preparation of a Second Roll containing
all the words of the First with many others like
them. We may now, in addition, note the following.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First there is the Divine Peradventure at the
beginning of the story.<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href="#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It may be</span></span>, God says,
that the people will hear and turn from their evil
ways that I may forgive their iniquity—a very
significant <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">perhaps</span></span> when taken with the Parable
of the Potter to which we are coming. Again,
the king at least understands the evil predicted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by Jeremiah to be the destruction of his land and
people by the King of Babylon.<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a> And again,
though some of the princes encourage the
Prophet's escape, and urge the king not to burn
the Roll, none are shocked by the burning.<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href="#note_331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a>
Evidently in 605-4 they were not so impressed
with the divinity of Jeremiah's word as they had
been in 608. Then they did not speak of telling
the king; now they say that they <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">must
tell</span></span><a id="noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href="#note_332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a> him.
Jehoiakim's malignant influence has grown, and
Jeremiah discovers the inconstancy of the princes,
even of some friendly to himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the same decisive year, 605-4, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the fourth of
Jehoiakim</span></span>, is referred an address by Jeremiah reported
in XXV. 1-11 (with perhaps 13<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>). This
repeats the Prophet's charge that his people have
refused—now for three-and-twenty years—to
listen to his call for repentance and reaffirms
the certainty, at last made clear by the Battle of
Carchemish, that their deserved doom lies in the
hands of a Northern Power, which shall waste
their land and carry them into foreign servitude
for seventy years. The suggestion that this
address formed the conclusion of the Second
Roll dictated by Jeremiah to Baruch is suitable
to the contents of the address and becomes more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
probable if we take as genuine the words in 13<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thus will I bring upon that land all My words which
I have spoken against her, all that is written in this
Book</span></span>. But a curious question rises from the fact
that we have two differing reports of the address.<a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href="#note_333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">333</span></span></a>
Very significantly the shorter Greek
Version contains neither the addition to the date,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar, king of
Babylon</span></span>, nor the two statements that his was the
Northern Power which would waste Judah and
which she should serve for seventy years (verses
1, 9, 11, as also the similar reference in verse 12),
all of which are inserted in the Hebrew text but
not without a sign of their being later intrusions
upon it.<a id="noteref_334" name="noteref_334" href="#note_334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">334</span></span></a> And indeed it is inconceivable that the
Greek translator could have omitted the four
references to Nebuchadrezzar (including that in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
verse 12) had he found them in the Hebrew text
from which he worked. Probably, therefore,
Jeremiah did not include them in the first version
of his address; and for this he had reason. His
purpose in the address was to declare the fulfilment
of the substance of all his previous prophesying,
and this had been not that the Chaldeans,
but that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a northern power</span></span>, would prove to be
the executioner of God's judgment upon Judah.
The references to Nebuchadrezzar were added,
possibly by Jeremiah himself or by Baruch, as
the Chaldean doom steadily drew nearer. The
interesting thing is that the earlier version of
the address survived and was used by the Greek
translator.<a id="noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href="#note_335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Verses 12-14, indicating the destruction of
Babylon in her turn after seventy years, are, in
whole or in part, generally taken as a post-exilic
addition.<a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href="#note_336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a> Omitting verse 14, the
Greek inserts between 13 and 15 the Oracles on Foreign
Nations, which the Hebrew postpones to Chs.

In the uncertain state of the text of
12-14 it is impossible to decide whether this was
or was not the original position of those Oracles.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The rest of the chapter, verses 15-38, is so full
of expansions and repetitions, which we may
partly see from a comparison of it with the
Greek, as well as of inconsistencies with some
earlier Oracles by Jeremiah,<a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href="#note_338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a> of traces of the later
prophetic style and of echoes of other prophets,
that many deny any part of the miscellany to
be Jeremiah's own. Yet we must remember that
his commission was not to Judah alone<a id="noteref_339" name="noteref_339" href="#note_339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">339</span></span></a> but to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the nations</span></span> as well, against many of which XXV.
15-38 is directed; and the figure of the Lord
handing to the Prophet the cup of the wine of
His wrath is not one which we have any reason
to doubt to be Jeremiah's. Sifting, by help of
the Greek, the Hebrew list of nations who are to
drink of the cup, we get Judah and Egypt;
Askalon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
Dedan, Tema, Buz, and their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">clipt</span></span> neighbours
in Arabia; all of whom were shaken in
Jeremiah's day by the Chaldean terror. Indeed
the reference to Ashdod suits the condition of
that Philistine city in the Prophet's time better
than its restored prosperity in the post-exilic
age. The substance of verses 15-23 may therefore
be reasonably left to Jeremiah. Verses
24-38 are more doubtful.<a id="noteref_340" name="noteref_340" href="#note_340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">340</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the reign of Jehoiakim are usually referred
a number of symbolic actions by Jeremiah, the
narratives of which carry no dates. So far as
they imply that the Prophet was still able to
move openly about Jerusalem and the country
they might be regarded as earlier than 604, when
he was under restraint and had to hide himself.<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href="#note_341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a>
But this is not certain. We are left to take them
in the order in which they occur in the Book.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first is that of the waist-cloth, XIII. 1-11.
Jeremiah was charged to buy a linen waist-cloth<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a>
and after wearing it, but keeping it from damp,
to bury it in the cleft of a rock, and after many
days to dig it up, when he found it rotting. So
had the Lord taken Israel to cleave to Him as
such a cloth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cleaves to the loins of a man</span></span>; but
separated from Him they had likewise rotted and
were good for nothing. Separated by what—God's
action or their own? As it stands the
interpretation is complicated. God spoils Israel
because of their pride (verse 9) and Israel spoil
themselves by disobedience and idolatry (verse 10).
The complication may be due to a later addition
to the text. But this question is not serious.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Neither is that of the place where Jeremiah is
said to have buried the cloth. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pĕrath</span></span>, the spelling
in the text, is the Hebrew name for the Euphrates
and so the Greek and our own versions render
it. But the name has not its usual addition of
The River. If the Euphrates be intended the
story is hardly one of fact, but rather a vivid
parable of the saturation of the national life by
heathen, corruptive influences from Mesopotamia.<a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href="#note_343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a>
Yet within an hour from Anathoth lies the Wady
Farah, a name which corresponds to the Hebrew
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pĕrath</span></span> or (by a slight change)
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parah</span></span>; and the
Wady, familiar as it must have been to Jeremiah,
suits the picture, having a lavish fountain, a broad
pool and a stream, all of which soak into the sand
and fissured rock of the surrounding desert.<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href="#note_344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a>
That the Wady Farah was the scene of the
parable is therefore possible, though not certain.<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345" href="#note_345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
But the ambiguity of these details does not interfere
with the moral of the whole.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This parable is immediately followed by the
ironic metaphor of the Jars Full of Wine, XIII.
12-14, which I have already quoted.<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href="#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a>

Next comes the Parable of the Potter, Ch.
XVIII, that might be from any part of the
Prophet's ministry, during which he was free
to move in public. This parable is instructive
first by disclosing one of the ways along which
Revelation reached, and spelt itself out in, the mind
of the Prophet. He felt a Divine impulse to go
down to the house of the Potter,<a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href="#note_347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and there I will
cause thee to hear My Words</span></span>, obviously not words
spoken to the outward ear. For, as Jeremiah
watched the potter at work on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his two
stones</span></span>,<a id="noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="#note_348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a>
and saw that when the vessel he first attempted
was marred he would remould the clay into
another vessel as seemed good to him, a fresh
conception of the Divine Method with men broke
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
upon Jeremiah and became articulate. A word
from the Lord flashed through his eyes upon his
mind, just as in his first visions of the almond-blossom
and the caldron.<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a>

Thus by figure and by word the Divine
Sovereignty was proclaimed as absolutely as
possible. But the Sovereignty is a real Sovereignty
and therefore includes Freedom. It is
not fettered by its own previous decrees, as some
rigorous doctrines of predestination insist, but is
free to recall and alter these, should the human
characters and wills with which it works in
history themselves change. There is a Divine
as well as a human Free-will. <span class="tei tei-q">“God's dealing

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Predestination of men or nations, which
the Prophet sees figured in the work of the potter,
is to Service. This is clear from the comparison
between Israel and a vessel designed for a definite
use. It recalls Jeremiah's similar conception of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his own predestination, which was not to a
certain state, of life or death, but to the office of
speaker for God to the nations. Yet because the
acceptance or rejection by a nation or an individual
of the particular service, for which God
has destined them, naturally determines their
ultimate fate, therefore this wider sense, which
predestination came to have in Christian doctrine,
is so far also involved in the parable.<a id="noteref_353" name="noteref_353" href="#note_353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the truths of the Divine Sovereignty and
the Divine Freedom the parable adds that of
the Divine Patience. The potter of Hinnom
does not impatiently cast upon the rubbish which
abounds there the lump of clay that has proved
refractory to his design for it. He gives the
lump another trial upon another design. If, as
many think, the verses which follow the parable,
7-10, are not by Jeremiah himself (though this is
far from proved, as we shall see) then he does not
explicitly draw from the potter's patience with
the clay the inference of the Divine patience with
men. But the inference is implicit in the parable.
Did Jeremiah intend it? If he did, this is proof
that in spite of his people's obstinacy under the
hand of God, he cherished, though he dared not
yet utter, the hope that God would have some
fresh purpose for their service beyond the wreck
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they were making of His former designs for them
and the ruin they were thereby bringing on
themselves—that He would grant them still
another chance of rising to His will. But if
Jeremiah did not intend this inference from his
parable then we may claim the parable as one
more example of that of which we have already
had several, the power of this wonderful man's
experience and doctrine to start in other minds
ideas and beliefs of which he himself was not
conscious, or which at least he did not articulate—that
power which after all is his highest
distinction as a prophet. I do not think, however,
that we can deny to Jeremiah all consciousness
of what his parable implies in regard to the
Patience of the Divine Potter with the perverse
human clay in His hands. For we have already
seen from another of the Prophet's metaphors
that under the abused and rank surface of a
nation's or an individual's life he was sure of soil
which by deeper ploughing would yet yield fruits
meet for repentance.<a id="noteref_354" name="noteref_354" href="#note_354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In either case the parable is rich in Gospel for
ourselves. If we have failed our God upon His
first designs for us and for our service do not let
us despair. He is patient and ready to give us
another trial under His hand. And this not only
is the lesson of more than one of our Lord's
parables, for instance that of the fig-tree found
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fruitless, but nevertheless given the chance of
another year,<a id="noteref_355" name="noteref_355" href="#note_355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a> and the motive of His hopes for the
publicans and harlots, but is implied by all the
Gospel of His life and death for sinners. In these
He saw still possibilities worth His dying for.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But as Christ Himself taught, there are, and
ethically must be, limits to the Divine Patience
with men. Of these the men of Judah and
Jerusalem are warned in the verses which follow
the parable. While it is true (verse 7 ff.) that if
a nation, which God has said He will destroy, turn
from its evil, He will relent, the converse is
equally true of a nation which He has promised
to plant and build, that if it do wrong and obey
not He will surely repent of the good He had
planned for it. For this refractory people of
Judah He is already <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">framing</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">moulding
evil</span></span>—the verb used is that of which the Hebrew name for
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">potter</span></span> is the participle. Though chosen of God
and shaped by His hands for high service Israel's
destiny is not irrevocable; nay, their doom is
already being shaped. Yet He makes still another
appeal to them to repent and amend their ways.
To this they answer: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">No use! we will walk after
our own devices and carry out every one the stubbornness
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
of his evil heart.</span></span> At least that is how Jeremiah
interprets their temper; his people had hardened
since Megiddo and the accession of Jehoiakim.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some moderns have denied these verses to
Jeremiah and taken them as the addition of a later
hand and without relevance to the parable. With
all respect to the authority of those critics,<a id="noteref_356" name="noteref_356" href="#note_356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a> I find
myself unable to agree with them. They differ
as to where the authentic words of the Prophet
cease, some concluding these with verse 4 others
with verse 6. In either case the parable is left
in the air, without such practical application of
his truths as Jeremiah usually makes to Judah or
other nations. Nor can the relevance of the
verses be denied, as Cornill, one of their rejectors,
admits. Nor does the language bear traces of
a later date. They seem to me to stand as
Jeremiah's own.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Prophet's threat of evil is still so vague,
that, with due acknowledgment of the uncertainty
of such points, we may suppose it, along with the
Parable of the Potter, to have been uttered before
the Battle of Carchemish, when the Babylonian
sovereignty over Western Asia became assured.<a id="noteref_357" name="noteref_357" href="#note_357"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">357</span></span></a>

The next in order of Jeremiah's symbols, Ch.
XIX, the breaking of a potter's jar past restoration,
with his repetition of doom upon Judah, led
to his arrest, Ch. XX, and this at last to his
definite statement that the doom would be captivity
to the King of Babylon. Some therefore
date the episode after Carchemish, but this is
uncertain; Jeremiah is still not under restraint
nor in hiding.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He is charged to buy an earthen jar and take

derived its name;<a id="noteref_359" name="noteref_359" href="#note_359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">359</span></span></a> and returning to the Temple
repeated the Lord's doom upon Judah and
Jerusalem. He was heard by Pashḥur of the
priestly guild of Immer, who appears to have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been chief of the Temple police, and after being
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">smitten</span></span> was put in the stocks, but the next day
released, probably rather because his friends
among the princes had prevailed in his favour
than because the mind of Pashḥur had meantime
changed. For Jeremiah on his release immediately
faced his captor with these words:—

of their foes, and thine own eyes shall be
seeing it; and all Judah shall I give into the
hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall

another action of the Prophet, which is the
exhibition rather of an example than of a symbol,
Ch. XXXV. The story was probably dictated by
Jeremiah to Baruch, for while the Hebrew text
opens it in the first person (2-5), the Greek version
carries the first person throughout and the later
change by the Hebrew to the third person (12
and 18) may easily have been due to a copyist
mistaking the first personal suffix for the initial
letter of the name Jeremiah.<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href="#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Rechabites, a tent-dwelling tribe sojourning
within the borders, and worshipping the God,
of Israel, had taken refuge from the Chaldean
invasion within the walls of Jerusalem. Knowing
their fidelity to their ancestral habits Jeremiah
invited some of them to one of the Temple
chambers and offered them wine. They refused,
for they said that their ancestor Jehonadab ben-Rechab<a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href="#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a>
had charged them to drink no wine,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
neither to build houses, nor sow seed nor plant
vineyards. Whereupon Jeremiah went forth and
held them up as an example to the men of Judah,
not because of any of the particular forms of
their abstinence, but because of their constancy.
Here were people who remembered, and through
centuries had remained loyal to, the precepts of
an ancestor; while Israel had fallen from their
ancient faithfulness to their God and ignored His
commandments. The steadfast loyalty of these
simple nomads to the institutions of a far-away
human father, how it put to shame Judah's
delinquency from the commands of her Divine
Father! This contrast is in line with the others,
which we have seen Jeremiah emphasising,
between his people's fickleness towards God and
the obdurate adherence of the Gentiles to their
national gods, or the constancy of the processes
of nature: the birds that know the seasons of their
coming, the unfailing snows of Lebanon and the
streams of the hills. The whole story is characteristic
of Jeremiah's teaching.<a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href="#note_363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the seventh to the tenth chapters of the
Book of Jeremiah there are a number of undated
passages in prose and in verse, which are generally
held to have been included in the collection of
the Prophet's Oracles written out by Baruch in
604-3, and of which some may have been delivered
during the reign of Josiah, but the most of
them more probably either upon its tragic close
at Megiddo in 608, or under Jehoiakim. We have
already considered the addresses reported in
VII. 1-15, 21-27,<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a> as well as the metrical fragments
VII. 28, 29, and VIII. 8, 9.<a id="noteref_365" name="noteref_365" href="#note_365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a> There are other
prose passages describing (1) VII. 16-20, the
worship of the Queen, or the Host, of Heaven,
which had been imposed upon Jerusalem by the
Assyrians, and either survived the decay of their
power from 625 onwards, or if suppressed by
Josiah in obedience to Deuteronomy,<a id="noteref_366" name="noteref_366" href="#note_366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">366</span></span></a> had been
revived under Jehoiakim; (2) VII. 30-34, the high-places
in Topheth, upon which children were
sacrificed, also condemned by Deuteronomy and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

the desecration of the graves of Jerusalem. It is
not necessary to reproduce these prose passages,
whether they be Jeremiah's or not; our versions
of them, Authorised and Revised, are sufficiently
clear.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there follow, from VIII. 4 onwards, after
the usual introduction, a series of metrical Oracles
of which the following translation is offered in
observance of the irregularity of the measures of
the original. Note how throughout the Prophet
is, as before, testing his false people—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">heeding</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">listening</span></span> are his words—finding no proof of a
genuine repentance and bewailing the doom that
therefore must fall upon them. Some of his
earlier verses are repeated, and there is the
reference to the Law, VIII. 8 f., which we have
discussed.<a id="noteref_368" name="noteref_368" href="#note_368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">368</span></span></a>
There is also a hint of exile—which,
however, is still future.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Ch. VIII, verses 4-12 (including the repetitions
they contain) seem a unity; verse 13
stands by itself (unless it goes with the preceding);
14, 15 echo one of the Scythian songs, but
the fear they reflect may be that either of an
Egyptian invasion after Megiddo or of a Chaldean;
16 and 17 are certainly of a northern invasion,
but whether the same as the preceding is doubtful;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and doubtful too is the connection of both
with the incomparable elegy which follows—VIII.
18-IX. 1. For IX. 1 undoubtedly belongs to this,
as the different division of the chapters in the
Hebrew text properly shows. In Ch. IX. 2-9
the Prophet is in another mood than that of the
preceding songs. There the miseries of his people
had oppressed him; here it is their sins. There
his heart had been with them and he had made
their sufferings his own; here he would flee from
them to a lodge in the desert.<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href="#note_369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">369</span></span></a> IX. 10-12, is
another separate dirge on the land, burned up
but whether by invaders or by drought is not
clear. Then 13-16 is a passage of prose. In
17-22 we have still another elegy with some of the
most haunting lines Jeremiah has given us, on
war or pestilence, or both. And there follow eight
lines, verses 23-24, on a very different, a spiritual,
theme, and then 25-26 another prose passage, on
the futility of physical circumcision if the heart be
not circumcised. If these be Jeremiah's, and there
is no sign in them to the contrary, they form
further evidence of his originality as a prophet.

On the other hand X. 17-23 is a small collection
of short Oracles in metre, which there is no reason
to deny to Jeremiah. The text of the first, verses
17-18, is uncertain. If with the help of the Greek
we render it as follows it implies not an actual,
but an inevitable and possibly imminent, siege of
Jerusalem. The couplet in 17 may alone be
original and 18, the text of which is reducible
neither to metre nor wholly to sense, a prose note
upon it.

Such is the most to be made of the fragment of
which there are many interpretations. The next
piece, 19-22, is generally acknowledged to be
Jeremiah's. It has the ring of his earlier Oracles.

The Hebrew and Greek texts differ as to the
speaker in 19<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>. Probably the Greek is correct—the
Prophet or the Deity addresses the city or
nation and the Prophet replies for the latter
identifying himself with her sufferings. It is
possible, however, that the words <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">But I said</span></span> are
misplaced and should begin the verse, in which
case the Hebrew <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></span> is to be preferred to the
Greek <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thy</span></span> adopted below. If so the stoicism of 19
is remarkable.

Another series of Oracles, as reasonably referred
to the reign of Jehoiakim as to any other stage of
Jeremiah's career, is scattered over Chs. XI-XX.
I reserve to a later lecture upon his spiritual conflict
and growth those which disclose his debates
with his God, his people and himself—XI. 18-XII.
6, XV. 10-XVI. 9, XVII. 14-18, XVIII. 18-23,
XX. 7-18, and I take now only such as deal
with the character and the doom of the nation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of these the first in the order in which they
appear in the Book is XI. 15, 16, with which we
have already dealt,<a id="noteref_419" name="noteref_419" href="#note_419"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">419</span></span></a> and the second is XII. 7-13,
generally acknowledged to be Jeremiah's own.
It is undated, but of the invasions of this time the
one it most clearly reflects is that of the mixed
hordes let loose by Nebuchadrezzar on Judah in
602 or in 598.<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href="#note_420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a>
The invasion is more probably
described as actual than imagined as
imminent. God Himself is the speaker: His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">House</span></span>,
as the parallel <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heritage</span></span> shows, is not the Temple
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but the Land, His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Domain</span></span>. The sentence pronounced
upon it is a final sentence, yet delivered
by the Divine Judge with pain and with astonishment
that He has to deliver it against His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Beloved</span></span>;
and this pathos Jeremiah's poetic rendering of the
sentence finely brings out by putting verse 9<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span> in
the form of a question. The Prophet feels the
Heart of God as moved as his own by the doom

Some see reflected in these lines the situation
after Megiddo, when Egyptian troops may have
worked such evils on Judah; but more probably
it is the still worse situation after the surrender
of Jerusalem to Nebuchadrezzar. There follows,
19-22, another prayer of the people (akin to that
following the drought, 7-9) which some take to
be later than Jeremiah. The metre is unusual, if
indeed it be metre and not rhythmical prose.

As the Book now runs this prayer receives from
God a repulse, XV. 1-4, similar to that which was
received by the people's prayer after the drought
XIV. 10-12, and to that which Hosea heard to the
prayer of his generation.<a id="noteref_432" name="noteref_432" href="#note_432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">432</span></span></a> Intercession for such
a people is useless, were it made even by Moses
and Samuel; they are doomed to perish by the
sword, famine and exile. This passage is in prose
and of doubtful origin. But the next lines are in
Jeremiah's favourite metre and certainly his own.
They either describe or (less probably) anticipate
the disaster of 598. God Himself again is the
speaker as in XII. 7-11. His Patience which the
Parable of the Potter illustrated has its limits,<a id="noteref_433" name="noteref_433" href="#note_433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">433</span></span></a>

Through the rest of Ch. XV and through
XVI and XVII are a number of those personal
passages, which I have postponed to a subsequent
lecture upon Jeremiah's spiritual
struggles,<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a> and
also several passages which by outlook and

sayings put together by an editor out of some
Oracles by our Prophet himself and deliverances
by other prophets on the same or similar themes.
In pursuance of the plan I proposed I take now only
those passages in which Jeremiah deals with the
character of his people and their deserved doom.

There follows a passage in prose, 10-13, which in
terms familiar to us, recites the nation's doom,
their exile. Verses 14, 15 break the connection
with 16 ff., and find their proper place in XXIII.
7-8, where they recur. Verses 16-18 predict,
under the figures of fishers and hunters, the
arrival of bands of invaders, who shall sweep the
country of its inhabitants, because of the idolatries
with which these have polluted it. There is no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reason to deny these verses to Jeremiah. In 19,
20 we come to another metrical piece, singing of
the conversion of the heathen from their idols—the
only piece of its kind from Jeremiah—which
we may more suitably consider later. Verse 21
seems more in place after 18.

These verses, characteristic of Jeremiah, are more
so of his earliest period than of his work in the
reign of Jehoiakim, and may have been among
those which he added to his Second Roll. They
are succeeded by the beautiful reflections on the
man who does not trust the Lord and on the man
who does, verses 5-8, quoted in a previous lecture.<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a>

In Ch. XVIII the Parable of the Potter is
followed by a metrical Oracle which has all the
marks of Jeremiah's style and repeats the finality
of the doom, to which the nation's forgetfulness
of God and idolatry have brought it. Once more
the poet contrasts the constancy of nature with
his people's inconstancy. Neither the metre nor
the sense of the text is so mutilated as some have
supposed.

Whether this piece of prose be from Jeremiah
himself or from another is uncertain and of no

We can reasonably deny to Jeremiah nothing
of all this passage, not even the prose by which
the metre is interrupted. We have seen how
natural it was for the rhapsodists of his race to
pass from verse to prose and again from prose to
verse. Nor are the repetitions superfluous, not
even that four-fold <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">into the hand of</span></span> in the prose

feel the grip of their captor closing more fast
upon the doomed king and people. Nor are we
required to take the pathetic words, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the land to

of those who have been long banished. For the
exiles to Babylon felt this home-sickness from the

The younger man, with youth's high hopes for
his people and ambitions for himself in their
service—ambitions which he could honestly
cherish by right both of his station in life<a id="noteref_465" name="noteref_465" href="#note_465"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">465</span></span></a>
and the firmness of his character—felt his spirit
spent beneath the long-drawn weight of all the
Oracles of Doom, which it was his fate to inscribe
as final. Now to Baruch in such a mood the
older man, the Prophet, might have appealed from
his own example, for none in that day was more
stripped than Jeremiah himself, of family, friends,
affections, or hopes of positive results from his
ministry; nor was there any whose life had been
more often snatched from the jaws of death. But
instead of quoting his own case Jeremiah brought
to his despairing servant and friend a still higher
example. The Lord Himself had been forced to
relinquish His designs and to destroy what He
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had built and to uproot what He had planted. In
face of such Divine surrender, both of purpose and
achievement, what was the resignation by a
mere man, or even by a whole nation, of their
hopes or ambitions? Let Baruch be content to
expect nothing beyond bare life: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thy life shall I
give thee for a prey</span></span>. This stern phrase is found
four times in the Oracles of Jeremiah,<a id="noteref_466" name="noteref_466" href="#note_466"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">466</span></span></a> and nowhere
else. It is not more due to the Prophet
than to the conditions of his generation. Jeremiah
only put into words what must have been felt by
all the men of his time—those terrible years in
which, through the Oracles quoted in this lecture,
he has shown us War, Drought, Famine and
Pestilence fatally passing over his land; when
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Death came up by the windows</span></span>, children were
cut off from their playgrounds and youths from
the squares where they gathered, and the corpses
of men were scattered like dung on the fields. It
was indeed a time when each survivor must have
felt that his life had been <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">given</span></span>
him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">for a prey</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the hearts of us who have lived through
the Great War, with its heavy toll on the lives
both of the young and of the old, this phrase of
Jeremiah brings the Prophet and his contemporaries
very near.

Yet more awful than the physical calamities
which the prophet unveils throughout these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
terrible years are his bitter portraits of the
character of his people, whom no word of their
God nor any of His heavy judgments could move
to repentance. He paints a hopeless picture of
society in Jerusalem and Judah under Jehoiakim,
rotten with dishonesty and vice. Members of
the same family are unable to trust each other;
all are bent on their own gain by methods
unjust and cruel—from top to bottom so hopelessly
false as even to be blind to the meaning of
the disasters which rapidly befal them and to the
final doom that steadily draws near. Yet, for all
the wrath he pours upon his generation and the
Divine vengeance of which he is sure, how the
man still loves and clings to them, and takes their
doom as his own! And, greatest of all, how he
reads in the heart that was in him the Heart of
God Himself—the same astonishment that the
people are so callous, the same horror of their
ruin, nay the same sense of failure and of suffering
under the burden of such a waste—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">on Me is the
waste!</span></span><a id="noteref_467" name="noteref_467" href="#note_467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">467</span></span></a>

Except that he does not share these secrets of
the Heart of God, it is of Victor Hugo among
moderns that I have been most reminded when
working through Jeremiah's charges against the
king, the priests, the prophets and the whole
people of Judah—Victor Hugo in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Châtiments</span></span> of

the monarch, the church, the journalists, the
courtiers and other creatures of the Third French
Empire. There is the same mordant frankness
and satiric rage combined with the same desire to
share the miseries of the critic's people in spite
of their faults. I have already quoted Hugo's
lines on Napoleon III as parallel to Jeremiah's on
Jehoiakim.<a id="noteref_468" name="noteref_468" href="#note_468"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">468</span></span></a>

respect for the one high influence left to him in
Jeremiah and the opposite pressure, first from a
set of upstarts who had succeeded to the estates
and the posts about court of their banished
betters, and second, from those prophets whose
personal insignificance can have been the only
reason of their escape from deportation. It is one
of the notable ironies of history that, while Nebuchadrezzar
had planned to render Judah powerless
to rebel again, by withdrawing from her all the
wisest and most skilful and soldierly of her population,
he should have left to her her fanatics!

The intrigues of Egypt persisted, however,
and, in 589 or 588, after the accession of Pharaoh

yielded to the party of revolt and Nebuchadrezzar
swiftly invested Jerusalem. Roused to realities
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the king and all the people of Jerusalem</span></span> offered their
repentance by a solemn covenant before God to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enfranchise, in obedience to the Law, those slaves
who had reached a seventh year of service. But
when on the news of an Egyptian advance the
Chaldeans raised their siege, the Jewish slave-owners
broke faith and pressed back their
liberated slaves into bondage.<a id="noteref_480" name="noteref_480" href="#note_480"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">480</span></span></a> This proved the
last link in the long chain of lies and frauds by
which the hopelessly dishonest people fastened
upon them their doom. Egypt again failed her
dupes. The Chaldeans, either by the terror they
inspired or by an actual victory on the field, compelled
her army to retire, and resumed the siege
of Jerusalem. Though Jeremiah counselled surrender
and though the city was sapped by famine
and pestilence, the fanatics—to whom, however
reluctantly, some admiration is due—held out
against the forces of Babylon for a year and a
half. Then came the end. The walls on the
north were breached. Ṣedekiah fled by a southern
gate, upon an effort to reach the East of
Jordan. He was overtaken on the plains of
Jericho, his escort scattered and himself carried
to Nebuchadrezzar's head-quarters at Riblah on
the Orontes. Thence, after his sons were slain
before his eyes, and his eyes put out, he was taken
in fetters to Babylon. Nebuṣaradan, a high
Babylonian officer, was dispatched to Jerusalem
to burn the Temple, the Palace and the greater

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From these rapidly descending years a number
of prophecies by Jeremiah have come to us, as
well as narratives of the trials which he endured
because of his faithfulness to the Word of the
Lord, and his sane views of the facts of the time.
As we read these prophecies and narratives
several changes become clear in the position and
circumstances of the Prophet, and in his temper
and outlook. Signally vindicated as his words
have been, we are not surprised that to his contemporaries
he has grown to be a personage of
greater impressiveness and authority than before.
He has still his enemies but these are not found
in exactly the same quarters as under Jehoiakim.
Instead of an implacable king, and princes more
or less respectful and friendly, in the king he has
now a friend, though a timid and ineffective one,
while the new and inferior princes appear almost
wholly against him. Formerly both priests and
prophets had been his foes, but now only the
prophets are mentioned as such, and at least one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
priest is loyal to him.<a id="noteref_482" name="noteref_482" href="#note_482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a> Inwardly again, he has
no more of those debates with God and his own
soul, which had rent him during the previous
years; only once does doubt escape from his
lips in prayer.<a id="noteref_483" name="noteref_483" href="#note_483"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">483</span></span></a> Clearest of all, his hope has
been released, and in contrast with his prophesying
up to the surrender of Jerusalem in 597, but
in full agreement with his enduring faith in God's
Freedom and Patience,<a id="noteref_484" name="noteref_484" href="#note_484"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">484</span></span></a>
he utters not a few predictions
of a future upon their own land for both
Israel and Judah. This greatest of the changes
which appear is due partly to the fact that while
the man's reluctant duty has been to pronounce
the doom of exile upon his people, that doom has
been fulfilled, and his spirit, which never desired
it,<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href="#note_485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a>
is free to range beyond its shadows. To the
clearness into which he rises he is helped, under
belief in the Divine Grace, by the truth obvious
to all but fanatics that peace and order were
possible for that shaken world only through
submission to Nebuchadrezzar's firm government,
including as this did a policy comparatively
lenient to the Jewish exiles. But there
was another and stronger reason why Jeremiah
should at last turn himself to a ministry of hope,
however sternly he must continue to denounce
the Jews left in Jerusalem and Judah. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
catastrophe of 597 largely separated the better
elements of the nation, which were swept into
exile, from the worse which remained in the
land.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is this drastic sifting, ethically one of the
most momentous events in the history of Israel,
with which Jeremiah's earliest Oracle under
Ṣedekiah is concerned, Ch. XXIV. Once more
the Word of the Lord starts to him from a vision,
this time of two baskets, one of good the other of
bad figs, which the Lord, he says, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">caused me to see</span></span>:
a vision which I take to be as physical and actual
as those of the almond-rod and the caldron upon
his call, or of the potter at his wheel, though
others interpret it as imaginative like the visions
of Amos.<a id="noteref_486" name="noteref_486" href="#note_486"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">486</span></span></a> Note how easily again the Prophet

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We cannot overestimate the effect upon Jeremiah
himself, and through him and Ezekiel upon the
subsequent history of Israel's religion, of this
drastic separation in 597 of the exiles of Judah
from the remnant left in the land. After suffering
for years the hopelessness of converting his
people, the Prophet at last saw an Israel of whom
hope might be dared. It was not their distance
which lent enchantment to his view for he gives
proof that he can descry the dross still among
them, despite the furnace through which they have
passed.<a id="noteref_493" name="noteref_493" href="#note_493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">493</span></span></a> But
the banished were without doubt
the best of the nation, and now they had <span class="tei tei-q">“dreed
their weird,”</span> gone through the fire, been lifted out
of the habits and passions of the past, and
chastened by banishment—pensive and wistful as
exile alone can bring men to be.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We also have come out of the Great War with
the best of us gone, and feel the contrast between
their distant purity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">out of great tribulation</span></span>, and the
unworthiness of those who are left. But neither
to Jeremiah nor to any of his time was such inspiration
possible as we draw from our brave,
self-sacrificing dead. No confidence then existed
in a life beyond the grave. Jeremiah himself can
only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">weep for the slain of his people</span></span>. His last vision
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of them is of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">corpses strewn on the field like sheaves left
after the reaper which nobody gathers</span></span>, barren of future
harvests; and the last word he has for them is,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">they went forth and are not</span></span>.<a id="noteref_494" name="noteref_494" href="#note_494"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">494</span></span></a> But that separated and
distant Israel has for the Prophet something at
least of what the cloud of witnesses by which we
are encompassed means for us. There was quality
in them, quality purified by suffering and sacrifice,
more than enough to rally the conscience of the
nation from which they had been torn. For the
Prophet himself they released hope, they awoke
the sense of a future, they revived the faith that
God had still a will for His people, and that by
His patient Grace a pure Israel might be re-born.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the vision of the Figs reveals the ethical
grounds of Jeremiah's new hope for Israel, his
Letter to the Exiles, XXIX. 1-23, discloses still
another ground on which that hope was based—his
clear and sane appreciation of the politics of
his time. And it adds a pronouncement of profound
significance for the future of Israel's religion, that
the sense of the presence of God, faith in His
Providence and Grace, and prayer to Him were
independent of Land and Temple.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the subsequent fortunes of the exiles we
know what liberal treatment they must have received
from Nebuchadrezzar. They were settled
by themselves; they were not, as in Egypt of old,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hindered from multiplying; they were granted
freedom to cultivate and to trade, by which many
of them gradually rose to considerable influence
among their captors. All this was given to
Jeremiah to foresee and to impress upon the first
exiles. But it meant that their exile would be
long.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is proof of the change in the Prophet's position
among his people<a id="noteref_495" name="noteref_495" href="#note_495"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">495</span></span></a> that his Letter was carried to
Babylon by two ambassadors from the King of
Judah to Nebuchadrezzar, and evidently with the
consent of Ṣedekiah himself. The text of the
Letter and of its title, originally no doubt from
Baruch's memoirs, has been considerably expanded,
as is clear not only from the brevity of
the Greek version, but from the superfluous
formulas and premature insertions which the
Hebrew and the Greek have in common. Following
others I have taken verses 5-7 as metre; and
if this is right we have a fresh instance of
Jeremiah's passing from metre to prose in the
same discourse. The metrical character of 5-7 is
not certain. Its couplets run on the following
irregular scheme of stresses: 3 + 4, 2 + 3, 3 + 3,
3 + 2 (?), 3 + 4, 3 + 4—the last line as so often

In one respect Jeremiah has not changed. His
denunciation of individuals who oppose the Word
of the Lord by himself is as strong as ever, and
still more dramatically than in the case of Shemaiah
it appears in his treatment of the prophets

subjection to Nebuchadrezzar, Chs. XXVII-XXVIII.
In this narrative or narratives (for the
whole seems compounded of several, perhaps
not all referring to the same occasion) the differences
between the Greek and Hebrew texts are
even more than usually great. The Greek again
attracts our preference by its freedom from superfluous
titles, repetitions and redundances, and is
probably nearer than the Hebrew to the original
of Baruch's Memoirs of the Prophet. But it is

It was the fourth year of Ṣedekiah, 593, when
messengers from the neighbouring nations came
to Jerusalem to intrigue under Egyptian influence
for revolt against Babylon. Jeremiah was commanded
to make a yoke of bars and thongs, and

The Hebrew text concludes with a prophecy of
the restoration of the vessels, which had it been
in the original the Greek translators could hardly
have omitted, and which is therefore probably a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">post factum</span></span> insertion. Not only, then, were the
sacred vessels taken away in 597 to remain in
Babylon, but such as were still left in Jerusalem
would also be carried thither. It is possible that
this address is now out of place and should follow
the next chapter, XXVIII, which deals only with
the vessels carried off in 597. Like the Hebrew
the Greek text gives XXVIII a separate introduction
which dates it in the fifth month of the fourth
year of Ṣedekiah, but omits the Hebrew statement
that the year was the same as that of the events
and words recorded in XXVII. The extent of
the differences between the Hebrew and Greek
continues to be at least as great as before,<a id="noteref_518" name="noteref_518" href="#note_518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">518</span></span></a> as

Jeremiah was still wearing his symbolic yoke
of wood and thongs in the Temple, when his prediction
that the sacred vessels would not be restored
was flatly contradicted and with as much
assurance that the contradiction was from the
God of Israel, as Jeremiah's assurance about his
own words. The speaker was like himself from

All praise to Baruch for his concise and vivid
report, and to the Greek translator who has reproduced
it! The editors of the Hebrew text
have diluted its strength.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With this narrative we are bound to take the
section of the Book entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Of the Prophets</span></span>, XXIII.
9-32. The text is in parts uncertain, and includes
obvious expansions. These removed, we can
fairly distinguish a continuous metrical form up
to 29, with the exception perhaps of 25-27. The
metre is sometimes irregular enough to raise
the suggestion<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href="#note_530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a>
that the whole is rhetorical
prose, between which and metre proper it is
often hard, as we have seen, to draw the line.
But we have also learned how often and how
naturally irregular, when the subject requires it,
Jeremiah's metres tend to become. So I have
ventured, with the help of the Greek, to render
the whole as metre, in which form are parts beyond
doubt. Verses 18 and 30-32 are in prose,
and both, but more probably the former, may
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be later additions, as are 19, 20, and clauses in
9, 10.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is no reason against taking the remainder
as Oracles by Jeremiah himself. No dates are
given them; they probably come from various
stages of his ministry, for he early found out the
false prophets, and his experience of them and
their errors lasted to the end. But probably this
collection of the Oracles was made under Ṣedekiah;
that Baruch gathered it still later is not
so likely.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have now all the material available for
judgment upon Jeremiah's life-long controversy
with the other prophets. His message and theirs
were diametrically opposite. But both he and
they spoke in the name of the same God, the God
of their nation. Both were convinced that they
had His Mind. Both were sure that their respective
predictions would be fulfilled. Each repudiated
the other's claim to speak in the name of
their nation's God. With each it was an affair of
strong, personal convictions, which we may grant,
in the case of some at least of Jeremiah's opponents,
to have been as honest as his. At first sight it
may seem hopeless to analyse such equal assurances,
based apparently on identical grounds, with
the view of discovering psychological differences
between them; and as if we must leave the issue
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the course of events to which both parties confidently
appealed. Even here the decision is not
wholly in favour of the one as against the others.
For Jeremiah's predictions in the Name of the
Lord were not always fulfilled as he had shaped
them. The northern executioners of the Divine
Judgment upon Judah were not the Scythians as
he at first expected; and—a smaller matter—Jehoiakim
was not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">buried with the burial of an ass,
dragged and flung out from the gates of Jerusalem</span></span>, but
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">slept with his fathers</span></span>.<a id="noteref_555" name="noteref_555" href="#note_555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">555</span></span></a> Yet these are only exceptions.
Jeremiah's prophesying was in substance vindicated
by history, while the predictions of the other
prophets were utterly belied. This is part of
Jeremiah's meaning when he says, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Of no profit
whatsoever are they to this people</span></span>.<a id="noteref_556" name="noteref_556" href="#note_556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">556</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What were the grounds of the undoubted difference?
On penetrating the similar surfaces of
Jeremiah's and the prophets' assurances we find
two deep distinctions between them—one moral
and one intellectual.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We take the moral first for it is the deeper.
Both Jeremiah and the prophets based their predictions
on convictions of the character of their
God. But while the prophets thought of Him
and of His relations to Israel from the level of that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tribal system of religion which prevailed throughout
their world, and upon that low level concluded
that Yahweh of Israel could not for any reason
forsake His own people but must avert from them
every disaster however imminent; Jeremiah was
compelled by his faith in the holiness and absolute
justice of God to proclaim that, however close and
dear His age-long relations to Israel had been and
however high His designs for them, He was by
His Nature bound to break from a generation
which had spurned His Love and His Law and
proved unworthy of His designs, and to deliver
them for the punishment of their sins into the
hands of their enemies.<a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href="#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">557</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What else can I do?</span></span>
Jeremiah hears God say. The opposing prophets
reply, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Not He!</span></span> This is the ground of his charge
against them, that they plan to make the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">people
forget the Name</span></span>, the revealed Nature and Character,
of God, just as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">their fathers forgat Him through
Baal</span></span>,<a id="noteref_558" name="noteref_558" href="#note_558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">558</span></span></a>
confusing His Nature with that of the lower, local
god.<a id="noteref_559" name="noteref_559" href="#note_559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">559</span></span></a>
This ethical difference between Jeremiah
and the prophets is clear beyond doubt; it was
profound and fundamental. There went with it
of course the difference between their respective
attitudes to the society of their time—on the one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
side his acute conscience of the vices that corrupted
the people, on the other their careless temper
towards those vices. They would <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">heal the hurt of
the daughter of my people lightly</span></span>, saying <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">it is well, it
is well when well it is not</span></span>, and in their prophesying
there was no call to repentance.<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a> Moreover,
though this may not have been true of all of them,
some both in Jerusalem and among the exiles were
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">partakers of other men's sins</span></span>; for Jeremiah charges
them with the prevailing immoralities of the day—adultery
and untruth. Instead of turning Judah
from her sins, they were the promoters of the
godlessness that spread through the land.<a id="noteref_561" name="noteref_561" href="#note_561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">561</span></span></a>
Though we have only Jeremiah's—or Baruch's—word
for this, we know how natural it has ever
been for the adherents, and for even some of the
leaders, of a school devoid of the fundamental
pieties to slide into open vice. Jeremiah's charges
are therefore not incredible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the grounds of the difference between
Jeremiah and the other prophets were also intellectual.
Jeremiah had the right eye for events
and throughout he was true to it. Just as he tells
us how the will of God was sometimes suggested
to him by the sight of certain physical objects—the
almond-blossom that broke the winter of
Anathoth, the boiling caldron, or the potter at his
wheel—so the sight of that in which the physical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and spiritual mingled, the disposition and progress
of the political forces of his world, made clear to
him the particular lines upon which the ethically
certain doom of Judah would arrive. He had the
open eye for events and allowed neither that
horror of his people's ruin, of which he tells us his
heart was full, nor any other motive of patriotism,
nor temptations to the easier life that had surely
been his by flattery and the promise of peace to
his contemporaries, to blind him to the clear and
just reading of his times, to which God's Word
and his faith in the Divine character had opened
his vision. On the contrary the other prophets,
to take them at their best, were blinded by their
patriotism, blinded by it even after Carchemish
and when the grasp of Babylon was sensibly
closing upon Judah—even after the first captivity
and when the siege of Jerusalem could only end
in her downfall and destruction. Nothing proved
sufficient to open such eyes to the signs of the
times.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Making allowance, then, for the fact that we
depend for our knowledge of the controversy upon
the record of only one of the parties to it, and
imputing to the other prophets the best possible,
we are left with these results: that as proved by
events the truth was with Jeremiah's word and
not with that of his opponents, and that the causes
of this were his profoundly deeper ethical conceptions
of God working in concert with his unwarped
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
understanding of the political and military
movements of his time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To this were allied other differences between
Jeremiah and the prophets who were against him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Along with the priests they clung to tradition,
to dogma, to things that had been true and vital
for past generations but were no longer so for this
one, which turned exhausted truths into fetishes.
To all these he opposed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Word of the Living
God</span></span>, Who spoke to the times and freely acted
according to the character and the needs of the
present generation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, the other prophets do not appear to
have attached any conditions to their predictions;
these they delivered as absolute and final. In
contrast, not merely were Jeremiah's prophecies
conditional but the conditions were in harmony
with their fundamentally moral spirit.
His doctrine of Predestination was (as we have
seen) subject to faith in the Freedom of the Divine
Sovereignty, and therefore up to the hopeless last
he repeated his calls to repentance, so that
God might relent of the doom He had decreed,
and save His people and His land to each
other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Further, despite his natural outbursts of rage
Jeremiah showed patience with his opponents,
the patience which is proof of the soundness of
a man's own convictions. He believed in <span class="tei tei-q">“the
liberty of prophesying,”</span>
</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jeremiah had no fear of the issue being threshed
out between them. The wheat would be surely
cleared from the straw.<a id="noteref_562" name="noteref_562" href="#note_562"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">562</span></span></a> That is a confidence
which attracts our trust. In the strength of it
Jeremiah was enabled to pause and reflect on the
apparently equal confidence which he encountered
in his opponents, and to give this every opportunity
to prove itself to him before he repeated his own
convictions. I cannot think, as many do, that his
words to Hananiah were sarcastic; and when
Hananiah broke the yoke on Jeremiah's shoulders,
and it is said, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">But Jeremiah went his way</span></span>, this was
not in contempt but to think out the issue between
them.<a id="noteref_563" name="noteref_563" href="#note_563"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">563</span></span></a>
Nor do I feel sarcasm in his wish that his
opponents' predictions of the return of the sacred
vessels from Babylon might be fulfilled.<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href="#note_564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a> His
brave calm words to the prophets and priests who
sought his life in the Temple in 604<a id="noteref_565" name="noteref_565" href="#note_565"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">565</span></span></a> bear
similar testimony. All these are the marks of an honest,
patient and reflective mind which weighs opinions
opposite to its own.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Further still, Jeremiah had to his credit that
of which his opponents appear to have been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
devoid. As we have seen no prophet was less
sure of himself, or more reluctant to discharge the
duties of a prophet. Everywhere he gives evidence
of being impelled by a force not his own
and against his will.<a id="noteref_566" name="noteref_566" href="#note_566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a> But the other prophets
show no sign of this accrediting reluctance. They
eagerly launch forth on their mission; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fling about
their tongues, and rede a Rede</span></span> of the Lord.<a id="noteref_567" name="noteref_567" href="#note_567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">567</span></span></a> They
give no impression of a force behind them.
Jeremiah says that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">they run of themselves</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prophesy of themselves</span></span>, they have not been
sent.<a id="noteref_568" name="noteref_568" href="#note_568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">568</span></span></a> We still
keep in mind that we owe the accounts of them to
Jeremiah and Baruch, their opponents. But our
own experience of life enables us to recognise
the portraits presented to us, as of characters
found in every age: pushful men, who have no
doubts of their omniscience, but, however patriotic
or religious or learned, leave upon their contemporaries
no impression of their being driven
by another force than themselves, and whose
opinions either are belied by events, or melt into
the air.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One point remains. In answering Hananiah
Jeremiah adduced the example of the acknowledged
prophets of the past as being always
prophets of doom, so that the presumption was in
favour of those who still preached doom; yet he
allowed that if any prophet promised peace, and
peace came to pass, he also might be known as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
genuine. That was sound history, and in the circumstances
of the day it was also sound sense.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
History has no harder test for the character
and doctrine of a great teacher than the siege of
his city. Instances beyond the Bible are those of
Archimedes in the siege of Syracuse, 212 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span>,
Pope Innocent the First in that of Rome by Alaric,
417 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span>, and John Knox in that of St. Andrews
by the French, 1547. A siege brings the prophet's
feet as low as the feet of the crowd. He shares
the dangers, the duties of defence, the last crusts.
His hunger, and, what is still keener, his pity for
those who suffer it with him, may break his faith
into cowardice and superstition. But if faith
stands, and common-sense with it, his opportunities
are high. His powers of spiritual vision may
prove to be also those of political and even of
military foresight, and either inspire the besieged
to a victorious resistance, or compel himself, alone
in a cityful of fanatics, to counsel surrender.
A siege can turn a prophet or quiet thinker into
a hero.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Old Testament gives us three instances—Elisha's
brave visions during the Syrian blockade
of Dothan and siege of Samaria; Isaiah, upon the
solitary strength of his faith, carrying Jerusalem
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
inviolate through her siege by the Assyrians; and
now a century later Jeremiah, with a more costly
courage, counselling her surrender to the Babylonians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The records of the Prophet's activity and sufferings
during the siege are so curiously scattered
through the Book and furnished with such headlines
as to leave it clear that they were added at
different times and possibly from different sources.
Some of them raise the question whether or not
they are doublets.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three, XXI. 1-10, XXXIV. 1-7, XXXVII. 3-10,
bear pronouncements by Jeremiah that the city
must surrender or be stormed and burned. Of
these the first and third each gives as the occasion
of the pronouncement it quotes, Ṣedekiah's mission
of two men to the Prophet. Several critics regard
these missions as identical. But can we doubt
that during that crisis of two years the distracted
king would send more than once for a Divine word?
And for this what moments were so natural as
when the Chaldeans were beginning the siege,
XXI. 4, and when they raised it, XXXVII. 5?
That one of the two messengers is on each occasion
the same affords an inadequate reason—and no
other exists—for arguing that both passages are but
differently telling the same story.<a id="noteref_569" name="noteref_569" href="#note_569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">569</span></span></a> Nor have any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grounds been offered for identifying the occasion
of either passage with that of XXXIV. 1-7. Thus
we have three separate deliverances from Jeremiah
to the king, each with its own vivid phrases and
distinctive edge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first, XXI 1-10, was given as the Chaldeans
closed upon Jerusalem but the Jews were not yet
driven within the walls.<a id="noteref_570" name="noteref_570" href="#note_570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">570</span></span></a> Ṣedekiah sent Pashḥur
and Ṣephaniah to inquire if by a miracle the Lord
would raise the siege. The grim answer came
that the Lord Himself would fight the besieged,
till they died of pestilence and the survivors were
slaughtered by Nebuchadrezzar—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span><a id="noteref_571" name="noteref_571" href="#note_571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; font-style: italic; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a><span style="font-style: italic"> shall not spare
nor pity them</span></span>—which is proof that this Oracle was
uttered before the end of the siege, when the
survivors were not slain but deported. The people
are advised to desert to the enemy—counsel which
we shall consider later.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second, XXXIV. 1-7, records a pronouncement
unsought by the king but evoked from

Jeremiah by the progress of the Chaldean arms,
which had overrun all Judah save the fortresses
of Jerusalem, Lachish and Azekah. Its vivid
genuineness is further certified by its unfulfilled
promise of a peaceful death for Ṣedekiah. The
following is mainly after the Greek.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is very remarkable how the spiritual powers of
the Prophet endowed him with these sound views
of the facts of his time, and of their eventualities
whether in the political or in the military sphere.
For nearly forty years he had foretold judgment
on his people out of the North: for eighteen at
least he had been sure that its instrument would
be Nebuchadrezzar and he had foreseen the first
deportation of the Jews to Babylonia. Now step
by step through the siege he is clear as to what
must happen—clear that the Chaldeans will invest
the city, clear when they raise the investment that
they will beat off the Egyptian army of relief and
return, clear that resistance to them is hopeless,
and will but add thousands of deaths by famine
and pestilence before the city is taken and burned
and its survivors carried into exile—all of which
comes to pass. But this political sagacity and
military foresight have their source in moral and
spiritual convictions—the Prophet's assurance of
the character and will of God, his faith in the
Divine Government not of a single nation but of
all the powers of the world, and his belief that a
people is saved and will endure for the service of
mankind, neither because of past privileges nor by
the traditions in which it trusts, nor by adherence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to dogmas however vital these have been to its
fathers, nor even by its passionate patriotism and
its stubborn gallantry in defence of land and
homes, but only by its justice, its purity, and its
obedience to God's will. These are the spiritual
convictions which alone keep the Prophet's eyes
open and his heart steadfast through the fluctuations
of policy and of military fortune that shake
his world, and under the agony of appearing to
be a traitor to his country and of preaching the
doom of a people whom he loves with all his soul.

The case of John Knox affords a parallel to
that of the Hebrew prophet. He told the garrison
and citizens of St. Andrews, when besieged by the
French, that <span class="tei tei-q">“their corrupt life could not escape
punishment of God and that was his continued
advertisement from the time he was called to
preach”</span> among them. <span class="tei tei-q">“When they triumphed of

he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘They should be but egg-shells!’</span> When

<span class="tei tei-q">‘Ye shall not see them, but ye shall be delivered

The second of Jeremiah's pronouncements
given above is followed by the story of the
besieged's despicable treatment of their slaves,
XXXIV. 8-22; based on a memoir by Baruch,
but expanded. Both the Hebrew and the shorter
Greek offer in parts an uncertain text, and add
this problem that their story begins with a
covenant to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">proclaim a Liberty</span></span><a id="noteref_581" name="noteref_581" href="#note_581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a> for the Hebrew
slaves in general, while the words which they
attribute to Jeremiah limit it to the emancipation,
in terms of a particular law, of those slaves who
had completed six years of service (verse 14).<a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href="#note_582"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">582</span></span></a>

to free their Hebrew slaves, obviously in order
to propitiate their God, and also some would
assert (though unsupported by the text) in order
to increase their fighting ranks; but when the
siege was raised they forced their freedmen back
to bondage: <span class="tei tei-q">“a deathbed repentance with the

About this time the ill-treatment of Jeremiah,

the king who asked, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Is there Word from the Lord?</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">There is</span></span>, he replied, and, as if drumming a lesson

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the King of

would not come to Judah—his irony was
not yet starved out of him!—and begged not to
be sent back to the vault. The king committed
him to the Court of the Guard, where at least he

Cornill seeks to save XXI. 9 by reading it as a
summons to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole</span></em> people to surrender and
so distinguishes it from XXXVIII. 2, advice <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to
individuals</span></em> to desert. I fail to follow this distinction.
The terms used are as individual in
the one verse as in the other; if the one goes the
other must also. But need either go? Duhm's
view is that both are from a later period, when
there was no longer a native government in
Judah, reverence for the monarchy was dead,
and the common conscience of Jewry was not
civic but ecclesiastical! This is ingenious, but
far from convincing. There are no grounds
either for denying these verses to Jeremiah, or
for reading his advice <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to go forth to the Chaldeans</span></span>
as meant otherwise than for the individual
citizens.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Was such advice right or wrong? The question
is much debated. The two German scholars just
quoted find it so wrong that they cannot think of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it as Jeremiah's. But in that situation and under
the convictions which held him, the Prophet could
not have spoken differently. He knew, and
soundly knew, not only that the city was doomed
and that her rulers who persisted in defending
her were senseless, if gallant, fanatics, but
also that they had forfeited their technical legitimacy.
To talk to-day of duty, civil or military,
to such a perjured Government does not even
deserve to be called constitutional pedantry, for
it has not a splinter of constitutionalism to support
it. Ṣedekiah held his vassal throne only by
his oath to his suzerain of Babylon and when he
broke that oath his legitimacy crumbled.<a id="noteref_591" name="noteref_591" href="#note_591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">591</span></span></a> Of
right Divine or human there was none in a
government so forsworn and self-disentitled,
besides being so insane, as that of the feeble king
and his frantic masters, the princes. For Jeremiah
the only Divine right was Nebuchadrezzar's.
But to the conviction that Ṣedekiah and the
princes were not the lawful lords of Judah, we
must add the pity of the Prophet as he foresaw
the men, women and children of his people done
to useless death by the cruel illusions of their
illegitimate governors. Calvin is right, when,
after a careful reservation of the duties of private
citizens to their government at war, he pronounces
that <span class="tei tei-q">“Jeremiah could not have brought better
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
counsel”</span> to the civilians and soldiers of Jerusalem.<a id="noteref_592" name="noteref_592" href="#note_592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">592</span></span></a>
And it is no paradox to say that the Prophet's
sincerity in giving such advice is sealed by his
heroic refusal to accept it for himself and resolution
to share to the end what sufferings the obstinacy
of her lords was to bring on the city. Nor, be it
observed, did he bribe his fellow citizens to
desert to the enemy by any rich promise. He
plainly told them that this would leave a man
nothing but bare life—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his life for a prey</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would, however, be most irrelevant to deduce
from so peculiar a situation, and from the Divine
counsels applicable to this alone, any sanction for
<span class="tei tei-q">“pacificism”</span> in general, or to set up Jeremiah as
an example of the duty of deserting one's government
when at war, in all circumstances and whatever
were the issues at stake. We might as well
affirm that the example of the man, who rouses
his family to flee when he finds their home
hopelessly on fire, is valid for him whose house
is threatened by burglars. Isaiah inspired resistance
to the Assyrian besiegers of Jerusalem
in his day with as Divine authority as Jeremiah
denounced resistance to the Chaldean besiegers
in his. Nor can we doubt that our Prophet
would have appreciated the just, the inevitable
revolt of the Maccabees against their pagan
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tyrants, which is divinely praised in the Epistle
to the Hebrews as a high example of faith. It is
one thing to deny allegiance, as Jeremiah did, to
a government that had broken the oath on which
alone its rights were founded, and the keeping of
which was the sole security for <span class="tei tei-q">“the stability of
the times.”</span> It is another and very different thing
to refuse, on alleged grounds of conscience, to
follow one's government when it lifts the sword
against a people who have broken <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em> oath,
and mobilises its subjects in defence of justice
and of the freedom of weaker nations, imperilled
by that perjury.

the Prophet. The thoughtful negro, perhaps
prompted by the women of the palace, procured
some rags and old clouts from a lumber room,
told Jeremiah to put them under his arm-pits to
soften the roughness of the ropes, and so drew
him gently from the mire and he was restored to
the Guard-Court. Ebed-melech had his reward
in the Lord's promise to save him from the men

experiences the Prophet, before he would answer,
asked if the king would put him to death for his
answer or act on his advice. The king swore
not to hand him over to the princes; so Jeremiah
promised that if Ṣedekiah would give himself
up to the Chaldeans he and his house would be
spared and the city saved. The king—it is
another credible trait in this weak character—feared
that the Chaldeans would deliver him to
the mockery of those Jews who had already
deserted to them. Jeremiah sought to reassure
him, again urged him to surrender, and then
burst out with the vision—an extraordinarily
interesting phase of prophetic ecstasy—of another
mockery which the king would suffer from his
own women if he did not yield but waited to be
taken captive.

The verse is in Jeremiah's favourite measure,
and its figures spring immediately from his experience.
The mire can hardly have dried on
him, into which he had been dropped, but at
least his friends had pulled him out of it; the
king had been forced into far deeper mire by
his own counsellors, and they were leaving him
in it!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The nervous king jibbed from the vision without
remark and begged Jeremiah not to tell what had
passed between them, but, if asked, to say that
he had been supplicating Ṣedekiah not to send
him back to the house of Jonathan; which answer
the Prophet obediently gave to the inquisitive
princes and so quieted them: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the matter was not
perceived</span></span>. He has been blamed for prevaricating.
On this point Calvin is as usual candid and sane.
<span class="tei tei-q">“It was indeed not a falsehood, but this evasion
cannot wholly be excused. The Prophet had an
honest fear; he was perplexed and anxious—it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would be better to die at once than be thus
buried alive in the earth.... Yet it was a kind
of falsehood. He confesses that he did as the
king charged him and there is no doubt that he
had before him the king's timidity.... He cannot
be wholly exempted from blame. In short, we
see how even the servants of God have spoken
evasively when under extreme fear.”</span> The prophets
were <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">men of like passions with ourselves</span></span>. By now
Jeremiah had aged, and was strained by the
flogging, the darkness, the filth and the hunger
he had suffered. Can we wonder at or blame
him? But with what authenticity does its frankness
stamp the whole story!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With most commentators I have treated Ch.
XXXVIII as the account of a fresh arrest of
Jeremiah and a fresh interview between him and
Ṣedekiah. I see, however, that Dr. Skinner takes
the whole chapter to be <span class="tei tei-q">“a duplication.”</span><a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href="#note_602"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">602</span></span></a> He considers
it a general improbability that two such
interviews, as XXXVII. 17-21 and XXXVIII.
14-27 relate, <span class="tei tei-q">“should have taken place in similar
circumstances within so short a time.”</span> Yet the
king was just the man to appeal to the Prophet
time after time during the siege. The similarities
in the two stories are natural because circumstances
were more or less similar at the various
stages of such a siege; but the differences are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more significant. The vivid details of XXXVIII
attest it as the account of an event and of sayings
subsequent to those related in XXXVII. The
Prophet's precaution, before he would answer, in
getting a pledge that he would not be put to
death nor handed over to the princes, as he had
already been, and his consent for Ṣedekiah's sake,
as well as for his own, to prevaricate to the
princes are features not found in the other reports
of such interviews, but intelligible and
natural after the terrible treatment he had
suffered. Dr. Skinner, too, admits that the two
accounts may be read as of different experiences
of the Prophet, <span class="tei tei-q">“if we can suppose that the
offence with which he is charged in XXXVIII.
1 ff. could have been committed while he was a
prisoner in the court of the guard;”</span> but this
appears to Dr. Skinner as <span class="tei tei-q">“hardly credible.”</span> Yet
the incidents related in XXXII. 6-15 show not
only that it is credible but that it actually
happened. In the East such imprisonment does
not prevent a prisoner, though shackled, from
communicating with his friends and even with
the gaping crowd outside his bars, as I have seen
more than once.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the Court of the Guard Jeremiah remained
till the city was taken.<a id="noteref_603" name="noteref_603" href="#note_603"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">603</span></span></a> He regained communication
with his friends; and it is not surprising
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to have as from this time several sayings by him,
or to discover from them that his heart, no longer
confined to reiterating the certain doom of the
city, was once more released to the hope of a
future for his people, hope across which the
shadow of doubt appears to have fallen but once.
His guard-court prophecies form part of that
separate collection, Chs. XXX-XXXIII, to which
the name The Book of Hope has been fitly given.
Of these chapters XXX and XXXI, without
date, imply that the city has already fallen and
the exile of her people is complete. But XXXII
and XXXIII are assigned to the last year of the
siege and to the Prophet's confinement to the
guard-court. There is now general agreement
that XXXII. 1-5 (or at least 3-5) are from a later
hand, which correctly dates the story it introduces
but attributes Jeremiah's imprisonment to
Ṣedekiah instead of to the princes, and even
seems to confound Ṣedekiah with Jehoiachin;
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> that the story itself, of a transaction
between Jeremiah and his cousin regarding some
family property, is genuine, dictated by the
Prophet to Baruch before or after the end of
the siege. Some reject as later all the rest of the
chapter: a long prayer by Jeremiah and the
Lord's answer to it, both of which are full of
deuteronomic phrases. Yet that an editor should
have made so large an addition to the book
without genuine material to work from is hardly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
credible; while it is characteristic of Jeremiah
to have fallen into the doubt his prayer reveals,
and this doubt would naturally be followed by a
Divine answer. But such original elements it is
not possible to discriminate exactly from the expansions
by which they have been overlaid.<a id="noteref_604" name="noteref_604" href="#note_604"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">604</span></span></a>

and thine the redemption; buy it for thyself.
Then I knew that it was the Lord's Word.
9. So I bought the field from Hanamel mine
uncle's son and weighed to him seventeen
silver shekels. 10. And I subscribed the deed
and sealed it and took witnesses, weighing the
money in the balances. 11. And I took the deed
of sale, both that which was sealed and that
which was open,</span><a id="noteref_605" name="noteref_605" href="#note_605"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">605</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">

of Neriah, son of Maḥseiah, in the sight of
Hanamel mine uncle's son, and in sight of
the Jews sitting in the guard-court. 13. And in
their sight I charged Baruch, saying, [14] Thus
saith the Lord of Hosts: Take this deed of sale
which is sealed, and this deed which is open,
and put them in an earthen vessel that they
may last many days. 15. For thus saith the Lord,
Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet
again be bought in this land.
16. Now after I had given the deed of sale to
Baruch, Neriah's son, I prayed to the Lord
saying, Ah Lord ... (?) [24] behold the mounts;
they are come to the city to take it, and the
city shall be given into the hands of the
Chaldeans who are fighting against it, because
of the sword and the famine and the pestilence;

and what Thou hast spoken is come to
pass, and, lo, Thou art seeing it. 25. Yet Thou
saidst to me, Buy thee the field for money, so I
wrote the deed and sealed it and took witnesses—whereas
the city is to be given into
the hands of the Chaldeans!

The tone of the expostulating Jeremiah is here
unmistakable; and (as I have said) a Divine
answer to his expostulations must have been given
him, though now perhaps irrecoverable from
among the expansions which it has undergone,
verses 26-44. Two things are of interest: the
practical carefulness of this great idealist, and the
fact that the material basis of his hope for his
country's freedom and prosperity was his own
right to a bit of property in land. Let those observe,
who deny to such individual rights any
communal interest or advantage. Jeremiah at
least proves how a small property of his own may
help a prophet in his hope for his country and
people.

All this is followed in Ch. XXXIII by a series
of oracles under the heading <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Word of the Lord
came to Jeremiah a second time while he was still shut

lacking in the Greek and could not have been
omitted by the translator had they been in the
original text, and because they are composed
partly of mere echoes of Jeremiah and partly of

consonant with his views of the institutions of
Israel, they are very generally rejected. So are
2 and 3 because of their doubtful relevance and
their style, that of the great prophet of the end of
the Exile. The originality of 1 and 4-13 has also
been denied. The question is difficult. But there
is no reason to doubt that the editor had good
material for the data in 1, or that under the Hebrew
text, which as it stands in 4, 5 is impossible<a id="noteref_606" name="noteref_606" href="#note_606"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">606</span></span></a> and

reflect the siege in progress, though if the date

of the ruined city, of peace and stability, of the
return of the exiles both of Judah and Israel and of
their forgiveness; Jerusalem shall again be a joy,
and the voices of joy, of the bridegroom and bride,
and of worship in the Temple, shall again be heard;
shepherds and their flocks shall be restored
throughout Judah and the Negeb. It would be
daring to deny to the Prophet the whole of this
prospect. The city was about to be ruined, its
houses filled with dead; the land had already been
ravaged. His office of doom was discharged; it is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not unnatural to believe that his great soul broke

of Nebuchadrezzar from the late Book of Daniel
instead of from the contemporary accounts of his
policy by Jeremiah, Baruch and Ezekiel. A proof
of his wisdom and clemency is here. While deporting
a second multitude to Babylonia in the
interests of peace and order, he placed Judah
under a native governor and chose for the post a
Jew of high family traditions and personal character.
All honour to Gedaliah for accepting so
difficult and dangerous a task! He attracted those
Jewish captains and their bands who during the
siege had maintained themselves in the country,<a id="noteref_612" name="noteref_612" href="#note_612"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">612</span></span></a>
and advised them to acknowledge the Chaldean
power and to cultivate their lands, which that year
fortunately produced excellent crops. At last
there was peace, and the like-minded Governor
and Prophet must together have looked forward
to organising in Judah the nucleus at least of a
restored Israel.

To this quiet interval, brief as it tragically
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
proved, we may reasonably assign those Oracles
of Hope which it is possible to recognise as
Jeremiah's among the series attributed to him in
Chs. XXX, XXXI. No chapters of the book
have been more keenly discussed or variously
estimated.<a id="noteref_613" name="noteref_613" href="#note_613"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">613</span></span></a> Yet at least there is agreement that
their compilation is due to a late editor who has
arranged his materials progressively so that the
whole is a unity;<a id="noteref_614" name="noteref_614" href="#note_614"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">614</span></span></a>
that many of these materials
are obviously from the end of the exile in the
style then prevailing; but that among them are
genuine Oracles of Jeremiah recognisable by their
style. These are admitted as his by the most drastic
of critics. It is indeed incredible that after such
a crisis as the destruction of the Holy City and
the exile of her people, and with the new situation
and prospect of Israel before him, the Prophet
should have had nothing to say. And the most
probable date for such utterances of hope as we
have now to consider is not that of his imprisonment
but the breathing-space given him after
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
586, when the Jewish community left in Judah
made such a promising start.<a id="noteref_615" name="noteref_615" href="#note_615"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">615</span></span></a>

From its measure and vivid vision the first
piece might well be Jeremiah's; but it uses Jacob,
the later literature's favourite name for Israel,
which Jeremiah does not use, and (in the last two
verses) some phrases with an outlook reminiscent
of the Second Isaiah. The verses describe a day
when the world shall again be shaken, but out of
the shaking Israel's deliverance shall come.

If these Qînah quatrains are not Jeremiah's,
some one else could match him to the letter and
the very breath. They would fall fitly from his
lips immediately upon the fulfilment of his people's
doom. Less probably his are the verses which
follow and abruptly add to his stern rehearsal of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
judgment on Judah the promise of her deliverance,
even introducing this with a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">therefore</span></span> as if
deliverance were the certain corollary of judgment—a
conclusion not to be grudged by us to

feels artificial, and lacks, be it observed, what

the doomed people to repent. Note, too, the
breakdown of the metre under a certain redundancy,
which is not characteristic of Jeremiah.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A poem follows which metrically and in substance
bears every mark of being Jeremiah's.
The measure is his favourite Qînah, and the
memory of the Lord's ancient love for Israel,
which had stirred the youth of the Prophet,<a id="noteref_626" name="noteref_626" href="#note_626"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">626</span></span></a> revives
in his old age and is the motive of his
assurance that Israel will be restored. It is of
Ephraim as well as of Judah that he thinks, indeed
of Ephraim especially. We have seen how the
heart of this son of Anathoth-in-Benjamin was
early drawn to the exiles from that province on
which the northward windows of his village
looked out.<a id="noteref_627" name="noteref_627" href="#note_627"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">627</span></span></a>
Now once more he was in Benjamin's
territory, at Ramah and at Miṣpah, with
the same northward prospect. Naturally his
heart went out again to Ephraim and its banished
folk. Of the priestly tribe as Jeremiah's family
were, their long residence in the land of Benjamin
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must have infected them with Benjamin's sense
of a closer kinship to Ephraim, the son of Joseph,
the son of Rachel, than to Judah, the son of Leah.
And there was, in addition, the influence of neighbourhood.
If blood be thicker than water it is
equally true that watered blood is warmed to
affection by nearness of locality and closeness of
association.<a id="noteref_628" name="noteref_628" href="#note_628"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">628</span></span></a>

It is questionable whether the opening couplet
quotes the deliverance of Israel from Egypt as a
precedent for the future return of the northern
tribes from captivity, described in the lines that
follow; or whether this return is at once predicted
by the couplet, with the usual prophetic
assurance as though it had already happened. If
we take <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the desert</span></span> as this is taken in Hosea II. 14,
we may decide for the latter alternative.

The everyday happiness promised is striking.
Here speaks again the man, who, while
ruin ran over the land, redeemed his ancestral
acres in pledge of the resettlement of all his
people upon their own farms and fields. He is
back in the country, upon the landscapes of his
youth, and in this fresh prospect of the restoration
of Israel he puts first the common joys and
fruitful labours of rural life, and only after these
the national worship centred in Jerusalem. Cornill
denies this last verse to Jeremiah, feeling it
inconsistent with the Prophet's condemnation of
the Temple and the Sacrifices.<a id="noteref_634" name="noteref_634" href="#note_634"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">634</span></span></a> But that condemnation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had been uttered by Jeremiah because
of his contemporaries' sinful use of the House of
God, whereas now he is looking into a new dispensation.
How could he more signally clinch
the promise of that reunion of Israel and Judah,
for which all his life he had longed, than by this
call to them to worship together?

The next poems no one denies to Jeremiah;
they are among the finest we have from him.
And how natural that he should conceive and
utter them in those quiet days when he was
at, or near, Ramah, the grave of the mother
of the people.<a id="noteref_646" name="noteref_646" href="#note_646"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">646</span></span></a> He hears her century-long
travail of mourning for the loss of the tribes
that were sprung from her Joseph, aggravated
now by the banishment of her Benjamin; but
hears too the promise that her travail shall
be rewarded by their return. The childless old
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
man has the soul of mother and father both—now
weeping with the comfortless Rachel and now,
in human touches unmatched outside the Parable
of the Prodigal, reading into the heart of God the
same instinctive affections, to which, in spite of
himself, every earthly father is stirred by the
mere mention of the name of a rebellious and
wandered son. The most vivid details are these:
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">after I had been brought to know</span></span>, which might also
be translated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">after I had been made to know myself</span></span>
and so anticipate <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">when he came to himself</span></span> of our
Lord's Parable; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I smote on my thigh</span></span>, the gesture
of despair; and in 20<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span> the very human attribution
to the Deity of surprise that the mere name
of Ephraim should move Him to affection, which
recalls both in form and substance the similar
question attributed to the Lord in XII. 9.

These prophecies of the physical restoration of
Israel and Judah are fitly followed by two, in what
is rather rhythmical prose than verse, which define
the moral and spiritual aspects of the new
dispensation; both laying stress on individual
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
responsibility, the one in ethics, 29, 30, the other
in religion, 31 ff., the proclamation of The New
Covenant. They are no doubt Jeremiah's: we
shall take them up in the last lecture.

The time of relief and fair promise, out of which
we have supposed that the Prophet conceived and
uttered the preceding Oracles, came to a sudden
and tragic close with the assassination of the good
governor Gedaliah by the fanatic Ishmael. Had
this not happened we can see from those Oracles
on what favourable lines the restoration of Judah
might have proceeded under the co-operation of
Gedaliah and Jeremiah, and how after so long and
heart-breaking a mission of doom to his people
the Prophet might at last have achieved before
his eyes some positive part in their social and
political reconstruction; for certainly he had
already proved his practical ability as well his
power of far vision. But even such sunset success
was denied him, and once more his people
crumbled under his hand. God provided some
better thing for him in the spiritual future of
Israel, to which he must now pass through still
deeper sacrifice and humiliation.<a id="noteref_661" name="noteref_661" href="#note_661"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">661</span></span></a>

Ishmael, against whom the noble Gedaliah would
take no warning, was one of those fanatics with
whom the Jewish nation have been cursed at all

was the same as had inspired the fatal defence of
Jerusalem, a blind passion against the Chaldean
rule. Having slain Gedaliah he attempted to
remove the little remnant at Miṣpah to the other
side of Jordan but was overtaken by a force under
Gedaliah's lieutenant, Johanan-ben-Kareah, and
his captives were recovered. Fearing the wrath
of the Chaldeans for the murder of their deputy,
the little flock did not return to Miṣpah but moved
south to Gidroth<a id="noteref_663" name="noteref_663" href="#note_663"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">663</span></span></a>-Chimham near Bethlehem,

The Prophet was the one hope left to them, and
like Ṣedekiah they turned to him in their perplexity
for a word of guidance from the Lord.
With his usual deliberation he took ten days to
answer, laying the matter before the Lord in
prayer; studying, we may be sure, the actual facts
of the situation (including what he already knew
to be the people's hope of finding security in Egypt)
and carefully sifting out his own thoughts and
impulses from the convictions which his prayers
brought him from God. The result was clear:
the people must abide in their land and not fear
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Chaldeans, who under God's hand would let
them be; but if they set their faces for Egypt, the
sword which they feared would overtake them.
This was God's Word; if they broke their promise
to obey it, they would surely die.<a id="noteref_665" name="noteref_665" href="#note_665"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">665</span></span></a>

With shame we read the rest of the story.
Jeremiah had well discerned<a id="noteref_666" name="noteref_666" href="#note_666"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">666</span></span></a> that those of his
countrymen, who had been deported in 597, were
the good figs of his vision and those who remained
the bad. The latter were of the breed that had
turned Temple and Sacrifice into fetishes, for as
such they now treated the Prophet, the greatest
whom God ever sent to Israel. Covetous of having
him with them they eagerly asked him for a Word
of the Lord, promising to obey it, in the expectation
of their kind that it would be according to
their own ignorant wishes; but when it declared
against these, they scolded Jeremiah as disappointed
barbarians do their idols, and presuming
on his age as a weakness, complained that he had
been set against them by Baruch, a philo-Chaldean
who would have them all carried off to Babylon!
So Baruch also—all praise to him—held the same
sane views of the situation as his Prophet and as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that wise governor Gedaliah. In spite of their
promise they refused to obey the Word of the Lord,
fled for Egypt carrying with them Jeremiah and
Baruch, and reached the frontier town of Tahpanhes.
How it must have broken the Prophet's
heart!<a id="noteref_667" name="noteref_667" href="#note_667"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">667</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But not his honesty or his courage! At
Tahpanhes he set before the fugitives one of those
symbols which had been characteristic of his
prophesying. He laid great stones in the entry
of the house of the Pharaoh and declared that
Nebuchadrezzar would plant his throne and spread
his tapestries upon them, when he came to smite
Egypt, assuming that land as easily as a shepherd
dons his garment; and after breaking the obelisks
of its gods and burning their temples he would
safely depart from it.<a id="noteref_668" name="noteref_668" href="#note_668"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">668</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So far the narrative runs clearly, but in Ch.
XLIV, the last that is written of Jeremiah, the
expander has been specially busy.<a id="noteref_669" name="noteref_669" href="#note_669"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">669</span></span></a> The chapter
opens, verses 1-14, with what purports to be an
Oracle by Jeremiah concerning, not the little band
which had brought him down with them, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">all the
Jews which were dwelling in the land of Egypt, at
Migdol and Tahpanhes</span></span>,<a id="noteref_670" name="noteref_670" href="#note_670"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">670</span></span></a> on the northern frontier,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and in the land of Pathros</span></span>, or Upper Egypt. It is
not said that these came to Tahpanhes to receive
the Oracle. Yet the arrival of a company fresh
from Judah and her recent awful experiences must
have stirred the Jewish communities already in
Egypt and drawn at least representatives of them
to Tahpanhes to see and to hear the newcomers.
If so, it would be natural for Jeremiah to expound
the happenings in Judah, and the Divine reasons
for them. No date is given for the Prophet's Oracle.
This need not have been uttered for some time
after he reached Egypt, when he was able to acquaint
himself with the conditions and character
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of his countrymen in their pagan environment,
and learn in particular how they had fallen away
like their fathers to the worship of other gods.
Such indeed is the double theme of the words attributed
to him. He is made to say that Jerusalem
and Judah are now desolate because of their
people's wickedness, and especially their idolatry,
in stubborn disobedience to the repeated Word of
their God by His prophets; surely a similar punishment
must befall the Jews in Egypt, for they also
have given themselves to idols. But so awkwardly
and diffusely is the Oracle reported to us that we
cannot doubt that, whatever its original form was,
this has been considerably expanded. At least
we may be sure that Jeremiah uttered some Oracle
against the idolatry of the Jews in Egypt, for in
what follows they give their answer.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From verse 15 the story and the words it
reports become—with the help of the briefer

may easily discriminate for himself.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This was a straight challenge to the prophet,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
returning to him the form of his own argument.
As he had traced the calamities of Judah to her
disobedience of Yahweh, they traced those which
hit themselves hardest as women to their having
ceased to worship Ashtoreth. What could Jeremiah
answer to logic formally so identical with
his own? The first of the answers attributed to
him, verses 20-23, asserts that among their other
sins it was their worship of the Queen of Heaven,
and not, as they said, their desisting from it,
which had worked their doom. But this answer
is too full of deuteronomic phrasing for the
whole of it to be the Prophet's; if any of it is
genuine this can only be part of the obviously
expanded opening, 21, 22<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The real, the characteristic answers of Jeremiah
are the others: to the women reported in
verses 24, 25, and to all the Jews in Egypt 26-28;
in which respectively he treats the claim of the
women ironically, and leaves the issue between
his word and that of his opponents to be decided
by the event. These answers also have been expanded,
but we may reasonably take the following
to be original.<a id="noteref_675" name="noteref_675" href="#note_675"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">675</span></span></a> Note how they connect in verse

fortunes it met with, we have followed over the

interest of many great lives lies in their natural
and fair development: the growth of gift towards
occasion, the beckoning of occasion when gift is
ripe, the sympathy between a man and his times,
the coincidence of public need with personal
powers or ambition—the zest of the race and the
thrill of the goal. With Jeremiah it was altogether
otherwise.

might have been <span class="tei tei-q">“I would be anywhere else than

If this represents the Prophet's earliest impression
of his charge, the proportion between
the destructive and constructive parts of it is
ominous; if it sums up his experience it is less
than the truth. Though he sowed the most
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fruitful seeds in the fields of Israel's religion,
none sprang in his lifetime. For his own generation
he built nothing. Sympathetic with the
aims and the start of the greatest reform in
Israel's history, he grew sceptical of its progress
and had to denounce the dogmas into which the
spirit of it hardened. A king sought his counsel
and refused to follow it; the professional prophets
challenged him to speak in the Name of the Lord
and then denied His Word; the priests were ever
against him, and the overseer of the Temple put
him in the stocks. Though the people came to his
side at one crisis, they rejected him at others and
fell back on their formalist teachers, and the
prophets of a careless optimism. Though he
loved his people with passion, and pled with them
all his life, he failed to convince or move them to
repentance—and more than once was forbidden
even to pray for them. He was charged not to
marry nor found a family nor share in either the
griefs or the joys of society. His brethren and his
father's house betrayed him, and he was stoned
out of Anathoth by his fellow-villagers. Though
he could count on a friend or two at court, he
had to flee into hiding. King Ṣedekiah, who felt
a slavish reverence for his word, was unable to
save him from imprisonment in a miry pit, and
he owed his deliverance, neither to friend nor
countryman, but to a negro eunuch of the palace.
Even after the fall of Jerusalem, when his prophecies
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were vindicated almost to the letter, he
failed to keep a remnant of the nation in Judah;
and his word had no influence with the little
band which clung to him as a fetish and hurried
him to Egypt. There, with his back to the brief
ministry of hope that had been allowed him, he
must take up again the task of denunciation
which he abhorred; and this is the last we hear
of him.

It was the same with individuals as with the
people as a whole. We may say that with few
exceptions, whomever he touched he singed,
whomever he struck he broke—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a man of quarrel
and strife to the whole land, all of them curse me</span></span>. And
he cursed them back. When Pashhur put him in
the stocks Jeremiah called him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magor Missabib</span></span>,
Terror-all-round, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">for lo, I will make thee a terror to
thyself and to all thy friends, they shall fall by the sword
and thou behold it</span></span>.<a id="noteref_687" name="noteref_687" href="#note_687"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">687</span></span></a> Nothing satisfied his contempt
for Jehoiakim, but that dying the king
should be buried with the burial of an ass.<a id="noteref_688" name="noteref_688" href="#note_688"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">688</span></span></a> Even
for Ṣedekiah, to whom he showed some tenderness,
his last utterance was of a vision of the weak
monarch being mocked by his own women.<a id="noteref_689" name="noteref_689" href="#note_689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">689</span></span></a>
His irony, keen to the end, proves his detachment
from all around him. His scorn for the bulk of
the other prophets is scorching, and his words
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for some of them fatal. Of Shemaiah, who wrote
of the captives in Babylon letters of a tenor
opposite to his own, he said <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he shall not have a man
to dwell among this people</span></span>.<a id="noteref_690" name="noteref_690" href="#note_690"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">690</span></span></a> When the prophet
Hananiah contradicted him, he foretold, after
carefully deliberating between his rival's words
and his own, that Hananiah would die, and
Hananiah was dead within a few months.<a id="noteref_691" name="noteref_691" href="#note_691"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">691</span></span></a> He
had no promise for those whom he counselled to
desert to the enemy save of bare life; nor anything
better even for the best of his friends:
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seekest thou great things for thyself? Seek them not!
Only thy life will I give thee for a prey in all places

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some have attributed the aggravations, at least,
of this rage to some fault in the man himself.
They are probably right. The prophets were
neither vegetables nor machines but men of
like passions with ourselves. Jeremiah may have
been by temper raw and hasty, with a natural
capacity for provoking his fellows. That he felt
this himself we may suspect from his cry to his
mother, that he had been born to quarrel. His
impatience, honest though it be, needs stern
rebuke from the Lord.<a id="noteref_733" name="noteref_733" href="#note_733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">733</span></span></a> Even with God Himself
he is hasty.<a id="noteref_734" name="noteref_734" href="#note_734"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">734</span></span></a> There are signs throughout,
naïvely betrayed by his own words, of a fluid
and quick temper, both for love and for hate. For
so original a poet he was at first remarkably dependent
on his predecessors. The cast of his
verse is lyric and subjective; and for all its wistfulness
and plaint is sometimes shrill with the
shrillness of a soul raw and too sensitive about
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
herself. His strength as a poet may have been his
weakness as a man—may have made him, from a
human point of view, an unlikely instrument for
the work he had to do and the force with which
he must drive—painfully swerving at times from
his task, and at others rushing in passion before
the power he hated but could not withstand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So probable an opinion becomes a certainty when
we turn to God's words to him. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Be not dismayed
lest I make thee dismayed</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I set thee this day a fenced
city and wall of bronze</span></span>.<a id="noteref_735" name="noteref_735" href="#note_735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">735</span></span></a> For these last imply that
in himself Jeremiah was something different.
God does not speak thus to a man unless He sees
that he needs it. It was to his most impetuous
and unstable disciple that Christ said, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thou art
Peter, and on this rock will I build</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet while his own temper thus aggravated his
solitude and his pain we must also keep in mind
that neither among the priests, the prophets and
the princes of his time, nor in the kings after
Josiah, did Jeremiah find any of that firm material
which under the hands of Isaiah rose into bulwarks
against Assyria. The nation crumbling
from within was suffering from without harder
blows than even Assyria dealt it. These did not
weld but broke a people already decadent and
with nothing to resist them save the formalities of
religion and a fanatic gallantry. The people lost
heart and care. He makes them use more than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
once a phrase about themselves in answer to his
call to repent: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">No'ash, No use! All is up!</span></span> Probably
this reflects his own feelings about them.
He was a man perpetually baffled by what he
had to work with.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Poet as he was he had the poet's heart for the
beauties of nature and of domestic life: for birds
and trees and streams, for the home-candle and
the sound of the house-mill, for children and the
happiness of the bride, and the love of husband
and wife; and he was forbidden to marry or have
children of his own or to take part in any social
merriment—in this last respect so different from
our Lord. Was it unnatural that his heart broke
out now and then in wild gusts of passion against
it all?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is another thing which we must not
forget in judging Jeremiah's excessive rage. We
cannot find that he had any hope of another life.
Absolutely no breath of this breaks either from
his own Oracles or from those attributed to him.
Here and now was his only chance of service,
here and now must the visions given him by God
be fulfilled or not at all. In the whole book of
Jeremiah we see no hope of the resurrection, no
glory to come, no gleam even of the martyr's
crown. I have often thought that what seem to
us the excess of impatience, the rashness to argue
with Providence, the unholy wrath and indignation
of prophets and psalmists under the Old
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Covenant, are largely to be explained by this,
that as yet there had come to them no sense of
another life or of judgment beyond this earth.
When we are tempted to wonder at Jeremiah's
passion and cursing, let us try to realise how we
would have felt had we, like him, found our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
service baffled, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">single</span></em> possible fulfilment
of our ideals rendered vain. All of which shows
the difference that Christ has made.

What was the powder which launched this
grim projectile through his times? Part at least
was his faith in his predestination, the bare sense

reluctant nature, his protesting affections, and his
adverse circumstance.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the first and all through it was God's choice
of him, the knowledge of himself as a thought of
the Deity and a consecrated instrument of the
Divine Will, which grasped this unbraced and
sensitive creature, this alternately discouraged
and impulsive man, and turned him, as we have
seen, into the opposite of himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The writers of the Old Testament give full
expression to the idea of predestination, but what
they understand by it is not what much of Jewish
and Christian theology has understood. In the
Old Testament predestination is not to character
or fate, to salvation or its opposite, to eternal life
or eternal punishment, but to service, or some
particular form of service, for God and man. The
Great Evangelist of the Exile so defines it for
Israel as a whole: Israel an eternal purpose of
God for the enlightenment and blessing of mankind.
And this faith is enforced on the nation, not
for their pride nor to foster the confidence that
God will never break from them, but to rouse their
conscience, and give them courage when they are
feeble or indolent or hopeless of their service.
So with Jeremiah in regard both to his own predestination
and that of his people. In his Parable
of the Potter (as we have seen) it is for service as
vessels that the clay is moulded; God is revealed
not as predestining character or quality, but as
shaping characters for ends for which under His
hand they yield suitable qualities. The parable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
illustrates not arbitrariness of election nor irresistible
sovereignty but a double freedom—freedom
in God to change His decrees for moral
reasons, freedom on man's part to thwart God's
designs for him. In further illustration of this
remember again the wonderful words, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Be thou not
dismayed before them, lest I make thee dismayed; if
thou wilt turn, then shall I turn thee</span></span>. To work upon
man God needs man's own will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From imagining the Deity as sheer absolute
will, to which the experience of the resistless force
behind his own soul must sometimes have tempted
him, Jeremiah was further guarded by his visions
of the Divine working in Nature. He is never
more clear or musical than when singing of the
regularity, faithfulness and reasonableness of
this. With such a Creator, such a Providence,
there could be neither arbitrariness nor caprice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having this experience of God's ways with man
it was not possible for Jeremiah to succumb to
those influences of a strong unqualified faith in
predestination which have often overwhelmed the
personalities of its devotees. Someone has talked
of <span class="tei tei-q">“the wine of predestination,”</span> and history both
in the East and in the West furnishes cases of men
so drugged by it as to lose their powers of will,
reason and heart, and become either apathetic unquestioning
slaves of fate, or violent and equally
unquestioning dogmatists and tyrants—the soul-less
instruments of a pitiless force. God overpowers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them: He is all and they are nothing. It
was far otherwise with Jeremiah, who realised and
preserved his individuality not only as against the
rest of his people but as against God Himself.
His earlier career appears from the glimpses we
get of it to have been, if not a constant, yet a
frequent struggle with the Deity. He argues
against the Divine calls to him. And even when
he yields he expresses his submission in terms
which almost proudly define his own will as over
against that of God:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The man would not be mastered, but if mastered
is not crushed. He questions each moment of his
own sufferings, each moment of his people's oncoming
doom. He debates with God on matters
of justice. He wrestles things out with God and
emerges from each wrestle not halt and limping
like Jacob of old, but firm and calm, more clear in
his mind and more sure of himself—as we see him
at last when the full will of God breaks upon his
soul with the Battle of Carchemish and he calmly
surrenders to his own and his people's fate. That
is how this prophet, by nature so fluid, and so
shrinking stands out henceforth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a fenced city and a

in God's discipline of such a soul. He sees his
servant's weakness and grants him the needful
athletic for it, by wrestling with him Himself.

This then is all the answer that the wearied and
perplexed servant gets from his Lord. The
troubles of which he complains are but the training
for still sorer. The only meaning of the
checks and sorrows of life is to brace us for worse.
It is the strain that ever brings the strength. Life
is explained as a graded and progressively strenuous
discipline, the result of it a stronger and more
finely tempered soul. But this surely suggests
the questions: Is that the whole result? Is the
soul thus to be trained, braced and refined, only
at last to be broken and vanish? These are
natural questions to the Lord's answer, but
Jeremiah does not put them. Unlike Job he
makes no start, even with this stimulus, to break
through to another life.

But in thus achieving his individuality over
against both his nation and his God, Jeremiah accomplished
only half of the work he did for Israel
and mankind. It is proof of how great a prophet
we have in him that he who was the first in Israel
to realise the independence of the single self in
religion should also become the supreme example
under the Old Covenant of the sacrifice of that
self for others, that he should break from one type
of religious solidarity only to illustrate another
and a nobler, that the prophet of individuality
should be also the symbol if not the conscious
preacher of vicariousness. This further stage in
Jeremiah's experience is of equally dramatic interest,
though we cannot always trace the order
of his utterances which bear witness to it.

Well might the Prophet wish to escape from
such a people—worn out with their falsehood,
their impurity, and their senseless optimism. Yet
it is not solitude for which he prays but some inn
or caravanserai where he would have been less
lonely than in his unshared house in Jerusalem,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sitting alone because of the wrath of the Lord</span></span>. His
desire is to be set where a man may see all the
interest of passing life without any responsibility
for it, where men are wayfarers only and come
and go like a river on whose bank you lie, and
help you to muse and perhaps to sing but never
touch the heart or the conscience of you. It is
the prayer of a poet sick of being a prophet and a
tester. Jeremiah was weary of having to look
below the surface of life, to know people long
enough to judge them with a keener conscience
than their own and to love them with a hopeless
and breaking heart that never got an answer to its
love or to its calls for repentance—wearied with
watching habit slowly grow from ill to ill, old
truths become lies or at the best mere formalities,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prophets who only flattered, priests to bless them,

But our prayers often outrun themselves in the
utterance and Jeremiah's too carried with it its
denial. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">My people—that I might leave my people</span></span>—this,
it is clear from all that we have heard from
him, his heart would never suffer him to do. And
so gradually we find him turning with deeper
devotion to the forlorn hope of his ministry, his
fate to feel his judgment of his people grow ever
more despairing, but his love for them deeper and
more yearning.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the year of Carchemish onward he appears
not again to have tried or prayed to escape.
Through the rest of the reign of Jehoiakim they
persecuted him to the edge of death. Prophets
and priests called for his execution. He was
stoned, beaten and thrust into the stocks. The
king scornfully cut up the roll of his prophecies;
and the people following their formalist leaders
rejected his word. With the first captivity under
Jehoiakim all the better classes left Jerusalem, but
he elected to remain with the refuse. When in
the reign of Ṣedekiah the Chaldeans came down
on the city and Jeremiah counselled its surrender
he was again beaten and was flung into a pit to
starve to death. When he was freed and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
besiegers gave him the opportunity, he would not
go over to them. Even when the city had fallen
and her captors hearing of his counsel offered him
security and a position in Babylonia, he chose
instead to share the fortunes of the little remnant
left in their ruined land. When they broke up it
was the worst of them who took possession of his
person and disregarding his appeals hurried him
down to Egypt. There, on alien soil and among
countrymen who had given themselves to an alien
religion, the one great personality of his time, who
had served the highest interests of his nation for
forty years, reluctant but unfaltering, and whose
scorned words, every one, had been vindicated by
events, is with the dregs of his people swept from
our sight. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He had given his back to the smiters and
his cheeks to them who plucked out the hair; he had not
hidden his face from the shame and the spitting. He
was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. He
was taken from prison and from judgment and cut off
from the land of the living; and they made his grave
with the wicked, though he had done no violence neither
was deceit in his mouth.</span></span> It is the second greatest
sacrifice that Israel has offered for mankind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If Jeremiah thus of his own will suffered <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with</span></em>
his people, and to the bitter end with the worst of
them, was he also conscious of suffering <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for</span></em> them?
After his death, when the full tragedy of his life
came home to his people's heart, the sense of the
few suffering for the many, the righteous for the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sinners, began to be articulate in Israel—remarkably
enough, let us remember, in the very period
when owing to the break-up of the nation the
single soul came to its own and belief in the responsibility
of every man for his own sins also
emerged and prevailed. Of the influence of the
example of Jeremiah's spiritual loneliness, combined
with his devotion to his sinful people, in
developing these doctrines of individualism and
self-sacrifice for others there can be no doubt.
The stamp of his sufferings is on every passage
in that exilic work <span class="tei tei-q">“Isaiah”</span> XL-LXVI, which
presents the Suffering Servant of the Lord and
declares the atoning virtues of His Agonies and
Death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it is not clear that Jeremiah ever felt anything
of this about himself; if he did so he has refrained
from uttering it. Yet he must have been
very near so high a consciousness. His love and
his pity for his sinful people were full. He can
hardly have failed to descry that his own spiritual
agonies which brought him into so close a
personal communion with God would show to
every other man the way for his approach also to
the Most High and Holy and his reconciliation
with his God. Again he was weighed down with
his people's sins; he bore on his heart the full
burden of them. He confessed them. The shame
which the people did not feel for them, he felt;
and he painted the curse upon them in words
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which prove how deeply the iron had entered his
own soul. He had a profound sense of the engrained
quality of evil,<a id="noteref_741" name="noteref_741" href="#note_741"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">741</span></span></a> the deep saturation of sin,
the enormity of the guilt of those who sinned
against the light and love of God.<a id="noteref_742" name="noteref_742" href="#note_742"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">742</span></span></a> A fallacy of
his day was that God could easily and would
readily forgive sin, that the standard ritual might
at once atone for it and comfortable preaching
bring the assurance of its removal. He denied
this, and affirmed that such things do not change
character; that no wash of words can cleanse
from sin, no sacraments, however ancient, can
absolve from guilt.<a id="noteref_743" name="noteref_743" href="#note_743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">743</span></span></a> That way only strict and
painful repentance can work; repentance following
the deep searching of the heart by the Word
and the Judgments of God and the agony of learning
and doing His Will.<a id="noteref_744" name="noteref_744" href="#note_744"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">744</span></span></a> To its last dregs he
drank the cup of the Lord's wrath upon His false
and wilful nation; he suffered with them every
pang of the slow death their sins had brought
upon them. And yet he was most conscious of
his own innocence when most certain of his fate.
The more he loyally gave himself to his mission
the more he suffered and the nearer was he
brought to death. The tragedy perplexed him,

The only reply he heard from heaven was the
order to stand fast, for God was with him to deliver—but
that more troubles awaited him. And
beyond this what is there to answer the staggering
Prophet save that if a man have the Divine gifts
of a keener conscience and a more loving heart
than his fellows, there inevitably comes with
such gifts the obligation of suffering for them.
Every degree in which love stands above her
brethren means pain and shame to love though
as yet she bear no thorn or nail in her flesh.
This spiritual distress Jeremiah felt for the people
long before he shared with them the physical
penalties of their sins. Just there—in his keener
conscience, in his hot shame for sins not his as
if they were his, in his agony for his people's
estrangement from God and in his own constantly
wounded love—lay his real substitution, his
vicarious offering for his people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Did Jeremiah ever conceive the far-off fulness
of the travail thus laid upon his soul, the truth
that this vicarious agony of a righteous man for
the sins of others is borne by God Himself? To
that question we have only fragments of an
answer. In his discourses, both earlier and later,
when he talks directly in the Name of the Deity—when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Deity speaks in the first person—the
words breathe as much effort and passion as
when Jeremiah speaks in his own person. The
Prophet is very sure that his God is Love, and he
hears that love utter itself in tones of yearning
for the love of men, and even of agony for their
sin and misery. There is, too, a singular prayer
of his which is tense with the instinct, that God
would surely be to Israel what Jeremiah had
resolved and striven to be—not a far-off God
who occasionally visited or passed through His
people, but One in their midst sharing their pain;
not indifferent, as he fears in another
place,<a id="noteref_746" name="noteref_746" href="#note_746"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">746</span></span></a> to
the shame that is upon them, but bearing even
this. The prayer which I mean is the one in
XIV. 8, 9, which recalls not only the terms but
the essence of Jeremiah's longing to escape from
his people, and lodge afar with wayfaring men,
aloof and irresponsible.

But they come out very fully in later prophets

We have followed the career of Jeremiah from
his call onwards to the end, and we have traced
his religious experience with its doubts, struggles,
crises, and settlement at last upon the things that
are sure: his debates with God and strifes with
men, which while they roused him to outbursts
of passion also braced his will, and stilled the
wilder storms of his heart. There remains the
duty of gathering the results of this broken and
gusty, yet growing and fruitful experience: the
truths which came forth of its travail, about
God and Man and their relations. And in particular
we have still to study the ideal form
which Jeremiah, or (as some questionably argue)
one of his disciples, gave to these relations: the
New Covenant, new in contrast to God's ancient
Covenant with Israel as recorded and enforced
in the Book of Deuteronomy.

Among the surprises which Jeremiah's own
Oracles have for the student is the discovery of
how little they dwell upon the transcendent and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
infinite aspects of the Divine Nature. On these
Jeremiah adds almost nothing to what his predecessors
or contemporaries revealed. Return
to his original visions and contrast them with
those, for example, of Isaiah and Ezekiel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Isaiah's vision was of the Lord upon a Throne,
high and lifted up, surrounded by Seraphim
crying to one another, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Holy, Holy, Holy is the
Lord of Hosts! the whole earth is full of His Glory!</span></span>
And their voices rocked the Temple and filled
it with smoke. Here are a Presence, Awful
Majesty, Infinite Holiness and Glory, blinding
the seer and crushing his heart contrite. Or
take the inaugural vision of Ezekiel—the storm-wind
out of the North, the vast cloud, the fire
infolding itself, the brightness round about and
out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber;
the rush and whirl of life that followed, wheels
and wings and rings full of eyes; and over this
the likeness of a firmament of the colour of the
terrible ice and the sound of wings like the noise
of many waters, as the Voice of the Almighty and
above the firmament a Throne and on the Throne
the Appearance of a Man, the Appearance of
the likeness of the Glory of the Lord. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">And I,
when I saw it, fell upon my face.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the inaugural visions of Jeremiah there is
none of this Awfulness—only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What art thou seeing
Jeremiah? the branch of an almond tree ... a caldron
boiling.</span></span> That was characteristic of his encounters
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and intercourse with the Deity throughout. They
were constant and close, but in them all we are
aware only of a Voice and an Argument. There
is no Throne, no Appearance, no Majesty, no
overwhelming sense of Holiness and Glory, no
rush of wings nor floods of colour or of song.<a id="noteref_748" name="noteref_748" href="#note_748"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">748</span></span></a>
Jeremiah takes for granted what other prophets
have said of God. But the Deity whose Power
and Glory they revealed is his Familiar. The
Lord talks with Jeremiah as a man with his
fellow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For this there were several reasons, and first
the particular quality of the Prophet's imagination.
His native powers of vision were not
such as soar, or at any rate easily soar, to the
sublime. He was a lyric poet and his revelations
of God are subjective and given to us by glimpses
in scattered verses, which, however intimate and
exquisite, have not the adoring wonder of his
prophetic peers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again there were the startled recoil of his
nature from the terrible office of a prophet in
such times, and those born gifts of questioning
and searching which fitted him for his allotted
duty as Tester of his people,<a id="noteref_749" name="noteref_749" href="#note_749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">749</span></span></a> but which he also

as we have seen, was largely a struggle with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Divine Will, and it left him not adoring but
amazed and perplexed. Such wrestling man's
spirit has to encounter like Jacob of old in the
dark, and if like the Patriarch it craves the Name,
which is the Nature, of That with which it
struggles, all the answer it may get is another
question, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wherefore askest thou after My Name?</span></span>
Morning may break, as it broke on Jacob by

But even here is none of the awe and high wonder
which fall upon Israel through other prophets.
Lyrist as he is and subjective, Jeremiah dwells
not so much upon the attributes of God on which
faith rests as upon the effects of faith in man.

Again by the desperate character of the times
he was starved of hope, the hope by which the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Apostle says <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">we are saved</span></span>, which not only braces
the will but clears the inner eyes of men and
liberates the imagination. As the years went
on he was ever more closely bound to the prediction
of his people's ruin, and, when this came,
to the sober counsel to accept their fate and settle
down to a long exile in patience for the Lord's
time of deliverance. As we have seen, his intervals
of release from so grim a ministry were
brief, and his Oracles of a bright future but few.
Even in these he does not rise, like the Evangelist
of the Exile whom he inspired, to exultation in
the Almighty Power of God or to visions of vast
spaces of the Divine Providence, or of Israel's
service wide as the world. His happy peasant-heart
is content to foresee his restored people
tending their vineyards again, enjoying their
village dances and festivals, and sharing with
their long divided tribes the common national
worship upon Ṣion.<a id="noteref_753" name="noteref_753" href="#note_753"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">753</span></span></a>

From the first Yahweh of Israel had been to the
faith of his people a God of Deeds. He delivered
them from Egypt, led them through the desert,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ever ready to avenge them on any who molested

victorious both over their foes and over every
natural obstacle which their life encountered.

It was all this activity and effectiveness, with
their sure results in history, which distinguished
Him from other gods, the gods of the nations,
who were ineffective, or as Jeremiah puts it
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">unprofitable—no-gods,
nothings</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">do-nothings, the work

On this line Jeremiah's monotheism marks a
notable advance; for alongside of faith in the
Divine Unity and Sovereignty there had lingered
even in Deuteronomy a belief in the existence
of other gods.<a id="noteref_766" name="noteref_766" href="#note_766"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">766</span></span></a> With Jeremiah every vestige

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet Jeremiah's monotheism, like that of all the
Hebrew prophets, is even more due to convictions
of the character of the God of Israel. We have
seen how he dwells on the Divine Love, faithful
and yearning for love in return, pleading and
patient even with its delinquent sons and
daughters;<a id="noteref_767" name="noteref_767" href="#note_767"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">767</span></span></a> but equal to this is his emphasis on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the righteousness of the Most High, by all His
deeds <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">working troth, justice, and judgment on the earth</span></span>,
which are His delight and the knowledge of which
is man's only glory.<a id="noteref_768" name="noteref_768" href="#note_768"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">768</span></span></a> He demands from His people
not sacrifices, which He never commanded to
their fathers, nor vows but a better life, justice
between man and man, and care for the weak
and the innocent.<a id="noteref_769" name="noteref_769" href="#note_769"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">769</span></span></a> To know Him is to do justice

fallen away from these, and practise and love
falsehood, slander, impurity, treacherous and
greedy violence, therefore God, being justice and
truth, must judge and condemn them: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What else
can I do?</span></span><a id="noteref_771" name="noteref_771" href="#note_771"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">771</span></span></a> The ethical necessity of the doom of

his heart struggles against it. But, if possible,
even more abhorrent to God than these sins
against domestic and civic piety in themselves, is
the fact that they are committed in the very face
of His Love and despite all its pleading. With
Jeremiah as with Hosea the sin against love is the
most hopeless and unpardonable, and this people
have sinned it to the utmost.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The modern mind deems arbitrary such immediate
linking of physical and political disasters with
the Wrath of God against sin. But we have to
ponder the following. The Prophet was convinced
of the ethical necessity of that Wrath and
of its judgments on Judah—he was convinced before
they came to pass and he predicted them accurately,
from close observation of the political
conditions of his world and the character of his
people. Granted these and God's essential and
operative justice, the connection was natural:
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What else can I do?</span></span> It was clear that Judah both
deserved and needed punishment and equally clear
that the boiling North held the potentialities of
this, which were gradually shaping and irresistibly
approaching. Moreover, as Jeremiah insists, and
as the history both of nations and individuals has
frequently illustrated, there is a natural sequence
of disaster upon wrong-doing. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Be thy scourge thine
own sin! Thy ways and thy deeds have done to thee
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
these things. Is it Me they provoke, saith the Lord,
Is it not themselves to the confusion of their faces?
Wherefore have these things come upon thee?—for the
mass of thy wickedness.</span></span><a id="noteref_779" name="noteref_779" href="#note_779"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">779</span></span></a> As St. Paul says <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
wages of sin</span></span>, not the judge's penalty on sin but
the thing it naturally earns, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is death</span></span>. Now one of
Jeremiah's most acute and convincing experiences
as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tester</span></span> of his people,<a id="noteref_780" name="noteref_780" href="#note_780"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">780</span></span></a> is his observation of
how all this worked out upon his own generation.
Not only were the war, the pestilence, and the
captivity, which were about to fall upon Jerusalem,
directly and obviously due to the perjury and
stupid pride of her rulers; but, as he more subtly
saw, the immorality of the whole people had been
disabling them, for years before, from meeting
these or any disasters except as sheer punishment
without place for repentance. Their previous
troubles had failed to sober or humble them or
rouse them. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">They would not accept correction</span></span>, he says
of them more than once.<a id="noteref_781" name="noteref_781" href="#note_781"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">781</span></span></a> To the Prophet's warnings
that God will judge them, they answer carelessly
or defiantly <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Not He!</span></span> Instead of yielding to
the power which lies in all adversity to cleanse the
heart and brace the will they became incapable of
shame, indifferent to consequences, and so past
praying for.<a id="noteref_782" name="noteref_782" href="#note_782"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">782</span></span></a> And in this they were fortified by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the specious dreams and lies of their false prophets,
continued to sin, and so fell to their doom,
abashed at last but unassoilable.<a id="noteref_783" name="noteref_783" href="#note_783"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">783</span></span></a> If at any time
they were startled by disaster, this found them
too enfeebled even for repentance by their habitual
insincerity or self-indulgence; which made them
incapable of truth even under pain, and of a real
conversion to God.<a id="noteref_784" name="noteref_784" href="#note_784"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">784</span></span></a> All this is discovered to us
by the eyes and the mouth of Jeremiah. What
in it is arbitrary? The record is awful, nothing
like it in literature. Yet every step is real. We
follow a master of observation.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But perhaps the chief glory of our Prophet is
that while thus delivering, as no other prophet
so fully or so ethically does, the just wrath of
God upon sin, he reveals at the same time that
His people's sin costs God more pain than anger.
This no doubt Jeremiah learned through his own
heart. As we have seen, with his whole heart he
loved the people whom he was called to test and
expose, and that heart was wracked and torn by
thoughts of the Doom which he had to pronounce
upon them. So also, he was given to feel, was
the heart of their God. In the following questions
there is poignant surprise; an insulted, a
wounded love beats through them.

of his own, and of our own and of every generation
which loves lies and lets itself be lulled by
them. Sin, he says, is no fiction nor a thing to
be lightly taken.<a id="noteref_789" name="noteref_789" href="#note_789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">789</span></span></a> Time for repentance is short;
doom comes quickly. Habits of evil are not carelessly
parted with, but have their long and necessary
consequences moral and physical. No wash
of words nor worship nor sacrament can cleanse
the heart or redeem from guilt. It is not the
flagrant sinner whom he chiefly warns, but those
who harden themselves softly. And—very
firmly this—forgiveness is not easily granted by
God nor cheaply gained by men; God has not
only set our sins before His face but carries them
on His heart. And therefore, in view both of
the Just Wrath of the Most High and of His
suffering Love, only repentance can avail, the
repentance which is not the facile mood offered
by many in atonement for their sins, but arduous,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rigorous and deeply sincere in its anguish. All
of which carries our prophet, six centuries before
Christ came, very far <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">into the fellowship of His
sufferings</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have already spoken sufficiently of Jeremiah's
other original contributions to theology, on the
Freedom and the Patience of the Providence of
God, and his hope that God would be to Israel
what the prophet had bravely tried to be—no
transient guest but a dweller in their midst.<a id="noteref_790" name="noteref_790" href="#note_790"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">790</span></span></a> The
titles for God which we may assume to have first
come from himself are few, perhaps only three:
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Fountain of Living Waters, the Hope of Israel and
the Saviour thereof in time of trouble</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hasidh, or
Loyal-in-Love</span></span>,<a id="noteref_791" name="noteref_791" href="#note_791"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">791</span></span></a> a term elsewhere applied only to
men. Sometimes, but not nearly so often as the
copyists of our Hebrew text have made him do,
he uses the title <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yahweh of Hosts</span></span>, doubtless in the
other prophets' sense of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the forces of history and of
the Universe</span></span> (the original meaning having been
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the armies of Israel</span></span>), sometimes he borrows the
deuteronomic <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yahweh thy God</span></span>, or a similar form.
But most often (as the Greek faithfully shows us)
it is simply the personal name <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yahweh</span></span> (Jehovah)
by which he addresses or describes the Deity:
significant of the long struggle between them as
individuals.

world of nature we observe how little the genuine
Oracles of Jeremiah have to tell us of the Divine
Power over this; yet the little is proclaimed with
as firm assurance as of God's control of the
history of mankind. Both worlds are His: the
happenings in the one are the sacraments, the
signs and seals, of His purposes and tempers
towards the other: the winter blossom of the
almond, of His wakefulness in a world where all
seems asleep; the sun by day and the moon and
stars by night, of His everlasting faithfulness to
His own.<a id="noteref_792" name="noteref_792" href="#note_792"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">792</span></span></a> All things in nature obey His rule

After all neither Nature nor the courses of
the Nations but the single human heart is the
field which Jeremiah most originally explores for
visions of the Divine Working and from which
he has brought his most distinctive contributions
to our knowledge of God. But that leads us up
to the second part of this lecture, his teaching
about man. Before beginning that, however, we
must include under his teaching about God, two
elements of this to which his insight into the
human heart directly led him.

Jeremiah was the first in Israel to assure his people
that the sense of God's presence, faith in His
Providence, His Grace, and Prayer to Him were
now free both of Temple and Land—as possible
on distant and alien soil, without Ark or Altar, as
they had been with these in Jerusalem. See his
Letter to the Exiles, and recall all that lay behind
it in his predictions of the ruin of the Temple,
and abolition of the Ark, and in his rejection
of sacrifices.<a id="noteref_798" name="noteref_798" href="#note_798"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">798</span></span></a> To Deuteronomy exile was the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the earliest Oracles of Jeremiah nations are
the human units in religion, Israel as a whole the
object of the Divine affection and providence.
To his age worship was the business of the nation:
public reverence for symbols and institutions, and
rites in which the individual's share was largely
performed for him by official representatives.
The prophets, and Jeremiah himself at first, dealt
with the people as a moral unity from the earliest
times to their own. The Lord had loved and
sought, redeemed and tended them as a nation.
As a nation they fell away from Him and now they
were wholly false to Him. When Jeremiah first
urges them to return, it is of a public and general
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
repentance that he speaks, as Deuteronomy
had done; and when his urgency fails it is their
political disappearance which he pronounces for
doom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But when the rotten surface of the national life
thus broke under the Prophet he fell upon the
deeper levels of the individual heart, and not only
found the native sinfulness of this to be the
explanation of the public and social corruption
but discovered also soil for the seed-bed of new
truths and new hopes. Among these there is
none more potent than that of the immediate
relation of the individual to God. Jeremiah never
lost hope of the ultimate restoration of Israel.
Nevertheless the individual aspects of religion
increase in his prophesying, and though it is
impossible to trace their growth with any accuracy
because of the want of dates to many of his Oracles,
we may be certain that as he watched under
Josiah the failure of the national movements for
reform, inspired by Deuteronomy, and under
Jehoiakim and Ṣedekiah the gradual breaking up
of the nation, and still more as his own personal
relations with the Deity grew closer, Jeremiah
thought and spoke less of the nation and more
of the individual as the object of the Divine
call and purposes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One has travelled by night through a wooded
country, by night and on into the dawn. How
solid and indivisible the dark masses appear and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
how difficult to realise as composed of innumerable
single growths, each with its own roots,
each by itself soaring towards heaven. But as
the dawn comes up one begins to see all this.
The mass breaks; first the larger, more lonely
trees stand out and soon every one of the
common crowd is apparent in its separate
strength and beauty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems to me as I travel through the Book of
Jeremiah that here also is a breaking of dawn—but
they are men whom it reveals. There is a
stir of this even in the earliest Oracles; for the
form of address to the nation which has begun
with the singular <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thou</span></span> changes gradually to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">You</span></span>, and not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Israel</span></span> but
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ye men of Israel</span></span> are called to
turn to their God.<a id="noteref_799" name="noteref_799" href="#note_799"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">799</span></span></a> As the Prophet's indictments
proceed his burden ceases to be the national
harlotry. He arraigns separate classes or groups,<a id="noteref_800" name="noteref_800" href="#note_800"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">800</span></span></a>
and then, in increasing numbers, individuals:
brother deceiving brother and friend friend;
adulterers each after the wife of his neighbour;
the official bully Pashhur, Jehoiakim the atrocious
and petty in contrast to his sire the simple and
just Josiah, the helpless and ridiculous Ṣedekiah,
the bustling and self-confident Hananiah<a id="noteref_801" name="noteref_801" href="#note_801"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">801</span></span></a>—with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the fit word and in sharp irony Jeremiah etches
them separately, in the same vividness as the
typical figures of the harlot watching for her prey
like the Arab robber in the desert, the fowler
crouching to fling his net, the shepherds failing
to keep their scattered flocks, the prophets who
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fling about their tongues and rede a rede of the
Lord</span></span>.<a id="noteref_802" name="noteref_802" href="#note_802"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">802</span></span></a>
Jeremiah has answered the call to him to search
for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></em>, the men beneath the nation.<a id="noteref_803" name="noteref_803" href="#note_803"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">803</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then there are his readings of the heart of man
into which he more deeply thought than any
other prophet of Israel: his revelation of the
working of God in the soul of man, its Searcher,
its only Guide and Strength; his stress upon individual
responsibility and guilt, and on the one
glory of man being his knowledge of God and
the duty of every man to know God for himself
and not through others; and his song of the
beauty of the personal life rooted in faith, evergreen
and yielding its fruit even in seasons of
drought. Such passages increase in the Oracles
of Jeremiah. Not ceasing to be the patriot, the
civic conscience of his people, he busies himself
more with the hearts, the habits, the sins and the
duties towards God of its individuals. Like Christ
he takes the deaf apart from the multitude and
talks to him of himself.

the dire happenings of the time, the unworthy
conduct of the people, their abandonment by
God, the ruin of the State and of the national

unless through doubt and struggle he himself
had won into the confidence of an immediate and
intimate knowledge of God. At his call he had
learned how a man could be God's before he was
his mother's or his nation's—God's own and to
the end answerable only to Him. He had proved
his solitary conscience under persecution. He
had known how personal convictions can overbear
the traditions of the past and the habits of
one's own generation—how God can hold a
single man alone to His Will against his nation
and all its powers, and vindicate him at last to
their faces. In all this lay much of the vicarious
service which Jeremiah achieved for his own
generation; what he had won for himself was
possible for each of them. And sure it is that
the personal piety which henceforth flourished
in Israel as it had never flourished before, weaving
its delicate tendrils about the ruins of the
state, the city and the altar, and (as the Psalms

We are now come to a confluence of the streams
we have been tracing—the prophecy of the New
Covenant. This occupies no incongruous place,
following hard as it does upon that of the eating
of sour grapes—individual inspiration upon individual
responsibility. But we cannot off-hand
accept it as Jeremiah's own; the critical questions
which have been with us from the beginning embarrass
us still.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The collection of Oracles to which that of the
New Covenant belongs, Chs. XXX, XXXI, was
not made till long after Jeremiah's time; it includes,
as we have seen, several of exilic or post-exilic
origin.<a id="noteref_814" name="noteref_814" href="#note_814"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">814</span></span></a> But so do other chapters of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Book, in which nevertheless genuine prophecies
of Jeremiah are recognised by virtually all modern
critics. The context therefore offers no prejudice
against the authenticity of the prophecy of the
New Covenant, XXXI. 31-34. But the form and
the substance of this have raised doubts, so honest
and reluctant as to deserve our consideration.
Duhm starts his usual objection that the passage
is in prose and a style characteristic of the late
expanders of the Book. We may let that go, as
we have done before, as by itself inconclusive;<a id="noteref_815" name="noteref_815" href="#note_815"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">815</span></span></a>
the prophecy may not have come directly from
Jeremiah's mouth but through the memory of a
reporter of the Prophet, Baruch or another. More
deserving of consideration is the criticism which
Duhm, with great unwillingness, makes of the
terms and substance of the prophecy. He objects
to the term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">covenant</span></span>: a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">covenant</span></span> is a legal contract
and could hardly have been chosen for the
frame of his ideal by so pronounced an anti-legalist
as Jeremiah. The passage <span class="tei tei-q">“promises a
new Covenant—not a new Torah but only a more
inward assimilation of the Torah by the people,
and emphasises the good results which this will
have for them but betrays no demand for a higher
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
kind of religion. If one does not let himself be
dazzled by the phrases <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">new covenant</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">write it on
the heart</span></span> then the passage tells us of the relation
of the individual no more than Deuteronomy has
already regarded as possible, XXX. 11 ff., and desirable,
VI. 6-8: namely, that every man should be
at home in the Law and honestly follow it.”</span> He
continues: <span class="tei tei-q">“it is impossible for me to hold any
longer to the Jeremian origin of the passage. I
find in it only the effusion of one learned in the
Scriptures who regards as the highest ideal, that
every one of the Jewish people should know the
Law by heart.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in his resolve <span class="tei tei-q">“not to let himself be dazzled”</span>
has not Duhm gone to the opposite extreme and
seriously under-read the whole spirit of the
passage—besides showing as usual undue apprehensiveness
of the presence in the text of a
legalist at work?<a id="noteref_816" name="noteref_816" href="#note_816"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">816</span></span></a> The choice of the term
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">covenant</span></span> for the frame of his ideal was not unnatural
to Jeremiah nor irrelevant to his experience
and teaching. Formally the term may mean
a legal contract; but it is open to a prophet or a
poet to use any metaphor for his ideals and
transform its mere letter by the spirit he puts into
it; and after all <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">covenant</span></span> is only a metaphor for a
relation which was beyond the compass of any
figure to express. Yet it was a term classical in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Israel and most intelligible to the generation
whom Jeremiah was addressing. Its associations,
especially as he had recalled them,<a id="noteref_817" name="noteref_817" href="#note_817"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">817</span></span></a> had been those
not of the Law but of Love. It was not a contract
or bargain but an approach by God to His people,
an offer of His Grace, a statement of His Will and
accompanied by manifestations of His Power to
redeem them. One might as well charge Jesus
with legalism in adopting a term sanctioned by
God Himself, and so historical, sacred and endeared
to the national memory. Nor need Torah,
or Law, be taken as Duhm takes it in its sense of
the legal codes of Israel, but in its wider meaning
of the Divine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">instruction</span></span> or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">revelation</span></span>. Further
the epithet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New</span></span> applied to Covenant was most
relevant to the Prophet's and his people's recent
sense of the failure of the ancient covenant, as restated
and enforced in Deuteronomy. In spite of
the excitement caused by the discovery of the Book
in which it was written, and the recital of its
words throughout the land, the Old Covenant had
failed to capture the heart of the people or to
secure from them more than the formal and superstitious
observance of the letter of its Torah.
Was it not a natural antithesis to predict that His
Torah would be set by God <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in their inward parts
and written on their hearts</span></span>? How else (will Duhm
tell us?) than by such phrases could the Prophet
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have described an inward and purely spiritual
process? To say as Duhm does that the phrases
only mean that common men would learn the
Law of God <span class="tei tei-q">“by heart”</span> (auswendig), is, whoever
their author may have been, to travesty his
meaning. Finally, all the phrasing of the New
Covenant is in harmony with the rest of the
Prophet's teaching. He had spoken of God's will
to give His people a new heart to know Him;<a id="noteref_818" name="noteref_818" href="#note_818"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">818</span></span></a>
he had taught religion as the individual's direct
knowledge of God;<a id="noteref_819" name="noteref_819" href="#note_819"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">819</span></span></a> he had won this himself from
God directly without help from his parentage, his
fellow-prophets or priests or any others; he had
most bitterly known also how weak the word of
one man is to teach his countrymen this
knowledge and that it can only come by the
inward operation of God Himself upon their
spirits; and he had made as clear as ever prophet
did that God's pardon for sin was the first, the
necessary preliminary to His other gifts. Nor is
the fact that the New Covenant is to be a national
one alien to his teaching: Jeremiah never lost
hope of his nation's survival and restoration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the passage on the New Covenant brings
together all the strands of Jeremiah's experience
and doctrine and hopes, shaken free from the
political debris of the times, into one fair web
under a pattern familiar and dear to the people.

the stuff and its dyes are all his own.

It is very difficult, if not impossible, to give a
correct account of the national and racial movements
which, along with the moral conditions in
Judah, called forth Jeremiah's Oracles of judgment
in the years immediately following his call in
627-626 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span> But the following facts are well
founded. In or about 625 the Medes were defeated
in an attack upon Assyria and their king
Phraortes was killed, but at the same time Asshurbanipal
died, and his weaker successor was compelled
to recognize the virtual independence of
Nabopolassar, the Chaldean in Babylon. Cyaxares
(624-585), the son of Phraortes, soon after
his succession to his father—say between 624 and
620—led a second Median assault upon Assyria
and besieged Nineveh, but had to retire because
of the onset from the north of the Scythians, the
Ashguzai of the Assyrian monuments, probably
the Ashkenaz or Ashkunza (?) of the Old Testament.
And then it was not for some years that
Cyaxares felt himself strong enough by his
alliance with Nabopolassar for a third Median
invasion of Assyria which culminated in the
capture and destruction of Nineveh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Assyrians appear to have been in touch with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Ashguzai for over a century and for a shorter
time probably in alliance with them; which
alliance was the cause of the Scythian advance
to the relief of Nineveh from its siege by the
Medes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">circa</span></span> 724-720
(see Winckler <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Die Keilinschriften
v. das alte Testament</span></span>, 3rd ed., pp. 100 ff.).
About the same time must be dated the Scythian
advance through Western Asia to the borders of
Egypt, which Herodotus (I. 103-104, IV. 1) reports.
Professor N. Schmidt (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Enc. Bibl.</span></span>, art.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Scythians”</span>) supposes that this advance was due
to the same Scythian-Assyrian alliance, in order
to preserve the Assyrian territories from the arms
of Psamtik of Egypt, who had since 639 been
besieging Ashdod; and he holds that this hypothesis
explains the absence of any record of
violence by the Scythians on their southern campaign,
except at Ashkelon. This precarious
hypothesis apart, we have the facts that no Biblical
chronicler records any invasion of Judah and
Benjamin by the Scythians, and yet that the
early Oracles of Jeremiah, generally attributed to
the alarms which the advance of such barbarian
hordes would excite in Judah, do closely fit the
Scythians (with a few exceptions that may be due
to the prophet's adaptation in 604 of his earlier
Oracles to the new <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">enemy</span></em> out of the north, the
Chaldeans).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There, are, however, modern writers who claim
that the Oracles in question were originally composed
not in view of the Scythian, but of the
Chaldean invasion of Palestine. So George
Douglas (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Book of Jeremiah</span></span>, London, Hodder
&amp; Stoughton, 1903), who, while assigning Jeremiah's
call to 627, relegates the two visions and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all the Oracles in the first part of the book to the
years following Jehoiakim's accession to the
Jewish throne in 608; cp. Winckler, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Geschichte
Israels</span></span>, I. pp. 112 f. and F. Wilke (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alttestamentliche
studien R. Kittel zum 60 Geburtstag dargebracht</span></span>, 1913),
quoted by John Skinner, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Prophecy and Religion</span></span>, pp.
42 f. n. 2. This would be an easy solution but
for the insuperable objections to it that the
Oracles in question far more closely fit the
Scythian, than the Chaldean, invasion; and that
Jer. I. 2, as distinctly covers prophecies of Jeremiah
in the days of Josiah as v. 3 does his
prophesying under Jehoiakim.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The date of Nineveh's fall has hitherto been accepted
as 607-606 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span> But in July of this year
(1923) Mr. C. J. Gadd described to the British
Academy a Babylonian tablet, which dates the
fall in the fourteenth year of Nabopolassar's reign
in Babylon. This year was 612 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span>, if it be right
to reckon the reign from 626-25 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">B.C.</span></span>; but as remarked
above, p. <a href="#Pg175" class="tei tei-ref">175</a>, Nabopolassar became in
that year officially not king but only viceroy.
Dependent as I was on a newspaper summary of

than offer for the fall of Nineveh the alternative

In addition to the accounts in the Books of Kings
and Chronicles of Pharaoh Nĕcoh's advance into
Asia in pursuance of his claim for a share of the
crumbling Assyrian Empire there are two independent
records: (1) Jeremiah XLVII. 1—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and
Pharaoh smote Gaza</span></span>—a headline (with other particulars)
wrongly prefixed by the Hebrew text, but
not by the Greek, to an Oracle upon an invasion
of Philistia not from the south but from the north
(see above, pp. <a href="#Pg013" class="tei tei-ref">13</a>,
<a href="#Pg061" class="tei tei-ref">61</a>); (2) by Herodotus, II. 159,
who says that <span class="tei tei-q">“Nĕcoh (Nekôs) making war by
land on the Syrians defeated them at Magdolos
and after the battle took Kadŭtis, a great city of
Syria.”</span> Magdolos is probably Megiddo, unless it
stands for Megdel, which, as well as Rumman
(= Hadad-rimmon, the scene of the mourning for
Josiah, Zech. XII. 11) lies near Megiddo. If, as
is usually held, Kadŭtis be Gaza, Herodotus has
reversed the proper order of Nĕcoh's two actions;
but Kadŭtis also suggests <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hak-Kôdēsh</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the holy</span></span>, an
epithet of Jerusalem (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jerusalem</span></span>, I. 270) which
would suit Herodotus' order, for it was after
Megiddo that Nĕcoh became master of Jerusalem
and Judah. The suggestion, though worth
mentioning, is doubtful; the epithet is late, exilic
and post-exilic; and Herodotus' phrase <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">took
Kadŭtis</span></span> is hardly equivalent to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">became paramount</span></span>
there as Nĕcoh became paramount in Jerusalem.

Lectures on <span class="tei tei-q">“The Septuagint and Jewish
Worship”</span> (for the British Academy, 1921) Mr. St. John
Thackeray presents clear evidence from the different vocabularies
in the Greek Version that this Version was the work of
two translators, the division between whom is at Ch. xxix.
verse 7. The dividing line cuts across the Greek arrangement
of the chapters, which sets the Oracles on Foreign Nations in
the centre of the Book. This shows that it was not the translators
who placed them there, but that the translators found the
arrangement in the Hebrew MS. from which they translated.
Further, he thinks that the division of the Book into two parts
was not made by the translators, but already existed in their
Hebrew exemplar. For this the Hebrew text gives two evidences:
(1) the titles of the Oracles, (2) the colophons appended
to two of them. The titles are some long, some short.
In the Hebrew order the Oracles with long titles are mixed up
with those with short, but in the Greek order the six with long
titles come together first and are followed by the five with short.
There are two colophons—one to the Moab Oracle, the other to
the Babylon Oracle; but the Moab Oracle stands last in the
Greek order and the Babylon Oracle last in the Hebrew order.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From all this two conclusions are drawn: (1) when the titles
were inserted the chapters were arranged as in the Greek,
which, therefore, was the original arrangement; (2) they afford
Hebrew evidence for a break or interruption in the middle of
the Oracles—the longer titles cease about the end of Part I of
the Greek Version, which therefore follows a division of the
Book into two parts that already existed in the Hebrew original
from which it was made. The Hebrew editor who amplified
the titles had apparently only Part I before him.

no point of contact in the authentic record of his life, is a
procedure of which no assured parallel is found in the book.

was rightly perceived by earlier critics
of last century, Movers, De Wette, Hitzig, etc., who mostly assigned
as a date the end of the exile and read the influence of
the Second Isaiah upon any Jeremian material that the chapters
may contain. In spite of objections by Graf their thesis was reaffirmed
and expanded by Stade (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gesch. Isr.</span></span> i. 643) and by Smend
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lehrbuch der A.T. Religionsgeschichte</span></span>, 1893), who denied that
any part of xxx, xxxi was from Jeremiah, on grounds both of alleged
inconsistencies with Jeremiah's teaching, and of the representations
of Judah with her people restored and her cultivation resumed.
But since Smend criticism has been more discriminating;
admitting post-exilic elements and consequently a late age for
the whole collection but reserving for our Prophet various passages: Giesebrecht,
